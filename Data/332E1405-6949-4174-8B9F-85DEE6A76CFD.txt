efficiency can reach ~23 % if 50 fins are installed 
on the aluminum plate.  The study shows that a 
double-layer roof can efficiently absorb solar energy 
and substantially reduce building air-conditioning 
loads.  On the high end of an organic Rankine cycle, 
a solar pond is used to replace the warm surface 
water of the sea as OTEC (ocean thermal energy 
conversion) is the driving energy for the ORC.  The 
energy collected from the double-layered solar roof 
can be pumped into the pond and raise the pond 
temperature as the pond surface area is equivalently 
increased by nearly one-fourth of the total area of 
the double-layer solar roof.  The effect of raising 
solar pond temperature is especially prominent if the 
double-layer solar roofs are installed in a community 
area.

working fluids which are suitable for converting the energy of warm surface sea water into power.  
Unfortunately, the estimated efficiencies are well below ~10 % as the heat source is the surface 
water of the ocean, shown in Fig. 1.  They also studied using a solar pond as an alternative for 
the warm surface sea water; and much higher efficiencies, as shown in Fig. 2, can be achieved if 
the solar pond supplies a higher water temperature between 40 to 60℃.  Therefore, a solar pond 
with a high water temperate would be an ideal modification to an ORC/OTEC system.  The 
main purpose of this study is to seek an extra energy source to raise the solar pond temperature, 
e.g., using a solar energy collection device – a double-layer solar roof.   
 
A by-product benefit of the solar roof is reducing radiation heat which might penetrate the 
building roof; and consequently, reducing building air-conditioning loads.  It was estimated [2] 
that radiation heat which penetrates the roof contributes 30 % of the air-conditioning loads in a 
normal family in semi-tropic area like Taiwan.  The solar energy emitting on the roof is usually 
2 to 3 times higher than those on façade and various side walls.  If the radiation heat can be 
insulated from penetrating the roof, the building air-conditioning loads would consequently be 
reduced dramatically.  A double-wall, triple-roof experimental solar house was built in a hot and 
humid area [3].  The results of monitoring the house for one year have shown that the 
double-wall, triple-roof designs are effective for insulating and removing heat from the building’s 
envelope.  These heat-insulating and exhausting strategies can maintain the diurnal fluctuation 
of indoor air temperature to within 2℃ on a typical mid-summer day.  In addition, 300 liters of 
hot water at temperatures of 35–54℃ can be obtained on any sunny day throughout the year, and 
most of the hot water can be supplied by the integrated solar system.  Using double-layer air 
channels on the envelop of an experimental chamber, Chiu [4] showed that, without any 
mechanical ventilation device, a naturally-induced air circulation can developed and three-fourths 
of the radiation heat is blocked from entering the chamber.  Khedari et al. [5] used a roof solar 
collector (RSC), which is made by using concrete roofing tiles on the outside and gypsum board 
on the inside, to minimize the fraction of the solar flux absorbed by the dwelling (insulation) on 
one hand; and to induce a natural ventilation which allows thermal comfort on the other hand.  
They studied the length and tilt angle of the RSC on its performance, and they found the optimum 
length of the SRC is shorter than 100 cm and the tilt angle is 30o.  Huang [6] analyzed the 
double-layer roof and estimated the buoyancy-driven air flow rate which can be applied to 
building cooling in a passive mode.  Other researches on double-layer solar roof can be found in 
Refs. 7 – 11.  It is conclusive that the idea of using a naturally occurred air flow which carries 
part of the radiation heat away is a viable and effective measure in building thermal shielding as 
well as energy collection.  The purpose of the current study is to optimize the double-layer solar 
roof in terms of the efficiency of carrying away radiation heat in order to reduce building 
air-conditioning loads and supply an extra energy source of the solar pond for the OTEC/ORC 
applications. 
 
Experimental setups and performance optimization 
 
The basic configuration of a double-layer solar roof, as shown in Fig. 3, is composed of two 
parallel plates in which air is driven by buoyancy due to absorption of radiation heat.  The 
energy carried away by the air flow is calculated by the following equation: 
 
𝑄 = � [?̇?．𝐶𝐶．(𝑇𝑜𝑜𝑜 − 𝑇𝑖𝑖)𝑑𝑑]𝑜
0
 
 
where ?̇? is the air mass flow rate exiting from the top of the channel, cp is the thermal capacity 
of the air, Tin and Tout are the entrance and exit air temperature, respectively, and Q is the total 
4 
 
to 34.9℃, the air velocity at the channel exit varies from 0.30 to 0.45 m/s, and the air temperature 
at the exit of the channel varies from 70.6 to 78.3℃.  The average solar intensity is 0.752 
kW/m2.  As compared with the base case, Case 2 exhibits a much better performance both in air 
exit temperature and air exit temperature due to a much higher value of radiation absorptivity of 
the black alumnium plate.  The efficiency of energy collection raises sharply to 6.5%. 
 
Case 4: Glass-covered and black-painted alumnium plate with a shorter length of channel 
The efficiency of energy collection may be a function of the channel length.  In Case 4 the 
length of the channel is shorten to 2.4 m.  As shown in Fig. 14, the ambient temperature varies 
from 27.4 to 32.1℃, the air velocity at the channel exit varies from 0.15 to 0.25 m/s, and the air 
temperature at the exit of the channel varies from 48.7 to 60.1℃.  The average solar intensity is 
0.513 kW/m2.  Case 4 does not perform better than Case 3 in air exit temperature and air exit 
velocity; however, it yields a higher efficiency of energy collection (9.7%) as the solar radiation 
intensity is much lower than Case 1 and the energy absorption is more efficient near the entrance 
region of the channel.  It also shows that a long double-layer solar roof is not necessary in otder 
to achieve a high efficiency of energy collection. 
 
Case 5: Glass-covered and black-painted alumnium plate with a shorter length of channel stuffed 
with heat-conducting material 
In an attempy on increasing heat conduction of the alumnium plate to air flow, the channel is 
stuffed with steel wires (shown in Fig. 15) in Case 5.  As shown in Fig. 16, the ambient 
temperature varies from 27.2 to 33.6℃, the air velocity at the channel exit varies from 0.1 to 0.15 
m/s, and the air temperature at the exit of the channel varies from 40.7 to 49.2℃.  The average 
solar intensity is 0.313 kW/m2.  Contrary to what is expected, Case 5 does not perform better 
than Case 4 as the efficiency of energy collection drops to 5.7% possibly due to a greater pressure 
drop occurred in the channel and/or a poor contact between the alumnium plate and the steel 
wires; and consequently, it results in a lower air mass flow rate.  This case suggests that heat 
conduction of the alumnium plate and pressure drop of the channel have to be compromised to 
reach an optimal performance.   
 
Case 6. Glass-covered and black-painted alumnium plate with a shorter length of channel slanted 
at a shallow angle (23o) 
In an attempt on maximizing the solar radiation intensity, the solar roof is slanted to a less steep 
angle, i.e., 23o.  As shown in Fig. 14, the ambient temperature varies from 29.3 to 33.6℃, the air 
velocity at the channel exit varies from 0.2 to 0.3 m/s, and the air temperature at the exit of the 
channel varies from 49 to 61.8℃.  The average solar intensity is 0.562 kW/m2.  As expected, 
Case 6 yields a higher efficiency of energy collection than Case 4 due to a higher solar radiation 
intensity.  However, an even shallower slant angle would impair air buoyancy; and consequently, 
reduce air mass flow rate.   
 
The experimental results show that the efficiency varies from 0.6 % to 11 % for the geometric 
configurations mentioned above.  Among all the parameters under consideration, the single 
parameter which affects and enhances the efficiency of energy collection the most is the solar 
absorptivity of the aluminum plate, i.e., a black-painted aluminum plate absorbs a much higher 
amount of solar energy than uncoated plate. 
 
In the light of enhancing heat conduction by introducing stuffed material in the channel, efforts 
should be emphasized on enhancing heat conduction yet with a tolerable increase of pressure 
drop.  A simple geometric modification which may fulfill both requirements is by installing fins 
on the aluminum plate.  Due to its difficulties in fabrication, the aluminum plate with fins is
