2Abstract
In this report, we present a simple method of selecting the partial cancellation factors 
(PCFs) for a two-stage hard-decision partial parallel interference cancellation (PPIC) detector 
for direct-sequence code-division multiple access (DS-CDMA) systems. Using Price’s 
theorem, we derive a range of the optimal PCFs for each PPIC stage in additive white 
Gaussian noise (AWGN) and multipath fading environments, where the lower and upper 
boundary values can be explicitly calculated from the processing gain and the number of users 
of the DS-CDMA system considered. Computer simulation results show that, using the 
average of the lower and upper boundary values as the PCF for each PPIC stage, the bit error 
rate (BER) performance closely approximates that of the real optimal PCFs under AWGN 
environments. Similar results are also obtained for multipath fading cases if the average of the 
lower and upper boundary values is used as the PCF for the first stage and the upper boundary 
value is used as the PCF for the second stage. Moreover, a two-stage PPIC detector using the 
proposed PCFs achieves comparable BER performance to a three-stage PPIC detector using 
arbitrary PCFs. This makes the proposed PCFs attractive for use in PPIC receivers in 
DS-CDMA systems. 
Keywords: code-division multiple access (CDMA), partial cancellation factors, partial 
parallel interference cancellation (PPIC), Price’s theorem, wireless communications. 
4Second, hard-decision PPIC requires fewer stages to achieve the best possible performance 
than soft-decision PPIC when sufficient knowledge of the amplitude and phase of each user 
are known at the receiver [13]. 
In this report, we first extend the work in [15] to derive a range of the optimal PCF for 
the second PPIC stage in an AWGN environment, and then derive ranges of the optimal PCF 
for both the first and second PPIC stages in a multipath fading environment, where the lower 
and upper boundary values of each range can be explicitly calculated from the processing gain 
and the number of users of the DS-CDMA system considered. Computer simulation results 
show that, using the average of the lower and upper boundary values as the PCF for each 
PPIC stage, the BER performance closely approximates that of the real optimal PCF under 
AWGN cases. Similar results are also obtained for multipath fading cases when the average of 
the lower and upper boundary values is used as the PCF for the first stage and the upper 
boundary value is used as the PCF for the second stage. With these results, reasonable PCFs 
can quickly be calculated without using time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations. It is worth 
mentioning that a two-stage PPIC detector using the proposed PCFs reaches comparable BER 
performance to a three-stage PPIC detector using arbitrary PCFs. In other words, under the 
same BER performance, the proposed PCF selection method can reduce the complexity of a 
PPIC detector, and is therefore attractive for use in DS-CDMA systems.

3.3.2 The Second PPIC Stage’s Results 
Using the results in Sections III-B and IV-A, we can derive a range of the optimal PCF at 
the second PPIC stage under a multipath channel as follows: 
14
calculated from (16) as (0.5422, 0.9335, 0.7379) and (0.2112, 0.7024, 0.4568), respectively. 
Fig. 2 shows the BER performance of a two-stage hard-decision PPIC detector with the 
optimal PCF at the first stage for different PCFs at the second stage under an AWGN 
environment. The corresponding optimal PCFs at the second stage for different SNRs are 
summarized in Table I. From (34), we can calculate the lower boundary, upper boundary, and 
average values for K   20, 40, 60 as (0.3104, 0.7728, 0.5416), (0.2416, 0.9087, 0.5752), 
and (0.2013, 0.9573, 0.5793), respectively. As shown by Fig. 2, the average value is a good 
choice for the PCF at the second PPIC stage for all the SNR cases.  
Fig. 3 shows the BER performance at each stage of a three-stage PPIC detector for 
different PCF arrangements at the first and second stages (i.e., the optimal, proposed, and 
arbitrary approaches). The PCFs at the first and second stages for these three-stage cases (i.e., 
p1 and p2) are given in Table II and p3 = 0.9 for all the cases. The simulation results 
demonstrate that the proposed PCF selection scheme approximates the optimal approach very 
well and clearly outperforms the arbitrary approach. Moreover, a two-stage PPIC detector 
with the proposed PCFs reaches comparable BER performance to a three-stage PPIC detector 
using arbitrary PCF selection for each stage. Note that the BER performance at the third stage 
for the case using the proposed PCFs at the first and second stages is even better than that of 
the case using the optimal PCFs at the first and second stages; this is due to the fact that p3 is 
an arbitrary value and it does not guarantee better BER performance for the latter case. 
3.4.2 Simulation Results in Multipath Fading Environments 
The multipath channel used in our simulations is based on the model given in Section II, 
where the number of paths for each user is six (L = 6). For each simulation, 1,000 packets are 
applied for each user and each packet contains an independent sequence of 1,000 bits with 
BPSK modulation. In addition, the channel is assumed to be quasi-static, i.e., having constant 
impulse response and no Doppler shift during every packet transmission. Fig. 4 shows the 
corresponding simulation results of a single-stage hard-decision PPIC detector for different 
PCFs, where the optimal PCFs for different SNRs are given in Table III. Similar to that 
illustrated in Fig. 1, the use of the average of the lower and upper boundary values given in 
(40) as the PCF results in close performance to the use of the real optimal PCF for all the 
SNR cases. 
Fig. 5 shows simulation results of a two-stage PPIC detector for different PCFs at the 
second stage under a multipath fading environment, where the optimal PCF is used at the first 
stage. The corresponding optimal PCFs at the second stage for different SNRs are presented 
16
SNR is high or low. It has also been shown that a two-stage PPIC detector using the proposed 
PCFs achieves comparable BER performance to a three-stage PPIC detector using arbitrary 
PCFs. This means that, to achieve the same BER performance, the number of stages (or 
complexity) required for a multistage PPIC detector can be reduced when the proposed PCFs 
are used. This feature supports that the proposed PCF selection method is of great value for 
the design of a PPIC receiver in DS-CDMA systems. Part of this work has been submitted for 
publication in the IEEE Transactions on Communications and the manuscript is under 
revision for the second-round review. In addition to the PCF selection method, we have also 
proposed a low-complexity iterative power allocation scheme for multiuser OFDM systems, 
which has been presented in the 2008 IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference - Spring (VTC 
2008-Spring), Singapore, May 2008.

Abstract 
In this midterm report, we present an optimal 
weighting factor (OWF) selection algorithm for the 
variance-reduced partial parallel interference 
cancellation (VRPPIC) technique proposed by Wang 
and Wu in multicarrier code division multiple access 
systems. In this approach, a monotonically increasing 
conditional variance function of weighting factors 
derived from the VRPPIC operations is minimized 
under some assumptions so that the OWFs can be 
easily obtained. It is interesting to see that the proposed 
OWFs for all interference cancellation stages are equal. 
Computer simulation results show that the proposed 
OWF selection algorithm can effectively enhance the 
system performance. 
Keywords: Multiple access interference (MAI); 
multicarrier code division multiple access (MC-
CDMA); optimal weighting factor (OWF); partial 
parallel interference cancellation (PPIC). 
二、緣由與目的 
Multicarrier code division multiple access (MC-
CDMA) is a combination of orthogonal frequency 
division multiplexing and code division multiple access 
(CDMA) that naturally has some advantages, such as 
efficient spectrum utilization and immunity to 
multipath impairment [1]-[3]. This technique is one of 
the promising approaches for fourth-generation 
wireless mobile communication systems. One major 
drawback of MC-CDMA is the multiple access 
interference (MAI) problem in the uplink. To alleviate 
this problem, multiuser detection is often necessary for 
an MC-CDMA uplink system. 
There have been many multiuser detection 
techniques available for CDMA or MC-CDMA 
systems. Among them, parallel interference 
cancellation (PIC) using parallel signal processing has 
received great attention because of its low complexity 
and processing delay [4]. For performance 
improvements, various improved versions of PIC have 
been proposed in the literature, such as partial PIC 
(PPIC) [5] and turbo PPIC [6], [7]. Basically, a PPIC 
scheme estimates MAI and partially cancels it from the 
received signal on a stage-by-stage basis. In [7], Wang 
and Wu introduced a bit estimator after the final stage 
of PPIC to form a variance-reduced PPIC (VRPPIC), 
which can further improve the performance of a PPIC 
scheme for MC-CDMA systems. 
The performance of a multistage PPIC detector is 
always affected by the weighting factors used at each 
stage. To ensure good performance, some optimal 
weighting factor (OWF) selection algorithms were 
proposed for CDMA systems based on minimizing the 
bit-error-rate (BER) [8], [9]. Since the complexity of 
BER analysis increases significantly with the number 
of interference cancellation (IC) stages, these 
approaches are generally not suitable for applications 
with more than two stages. 
In this report, we develop a simple OWF selection 
algorithm without complicated BER analysis for 
VRPPIC in MC-CDMA systems. In this approach, a 
monotonically increasing conditional variance function 
of weighting factors is first derived according to the 
VRPPIC operations, and it is then minimized under 
some assumptions to find the OWF solutions. It is 
interesting to see that the proposed OWFs for all IC 
stages are equal. Computer simulation results show that 
our proposed OWF selection algorithm can enhance the 
system performance in different system loading 
scenarios. 
三、結果與討論 
3.1 SYSTEM MODEL 
Consider a quasi-synchronous MC-CDMA uplink 
system with K active users, where we assume that the 
spreading factor N (≧K) is equal to the number of 
subcarriers. Without considering pulse shaping, the 
frequency domain received data vector (after the 
discrete Fourier transform operation) at the receiver 
can be represented by 
3.2.2.2 OWF selection subject to a given first-IC-
stage’s weighting factor 
Given the first-IC-stage’s weighting factor, the OWF 
selection algorithm can be summarized by

where (1)Gβ  is a value that needs to be determined 
appropriately. It is shown in the Appendix that the 
conditional variance function in (8) is monotonically 
increasing with the final weighting factor ( )Mβ . 
Therefore, the solution of (9) can be easily obtained 
without any calculation; that is,

Note that the linear combination in the VRPPIC 
detector is based on (6), so the fidelity of soft decisions 
at each IC stage is still considered when the proposed 
OWFs in (10) are applied. 
3.3  SIMULATION RESULTS 
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 
OWF selection algorithm, computer simulations were 
performed for the VRPPIC detector in an MC-CDMA 
uplink system. For the purpose of comparison, the 
proposed OWFs ( OWFβ ), the full-search based OWFs 
( FSβ ), and the randomly selected weighting factors 
( RSβ ) were considered. The number of IC stages was 
set to be M=3. Here we find an appropriate weighting 
factor of the first IC stage (1)Gβ  by numerically 
searching for one dimension in the (0, 1) interval at 
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) = 14dB such that the BER 
of the 1-stage PPIC is minimized and obtain the full-
search based OWFs FSβ  by numerically searching for 
three dimensions in the same interval at each SNR case 
such that the BER of VRPPIC is minimized. Although 
the full-search approach for three dimensions is 
impractical, the corresponding results can be used as a 
performance reference of the proposed OWF selection

Abstract 
In this midterm report, we propose a multiple-
pulse interference (MPI) cancellation scheme for 
ultra-wideband systems using pulse shape modulation. 
The proposed scheme is based on a similar concept to 
parallel interference cancellation for code-division 
multiple-access systems, where a specific training 
sequence structure is used to estimate the channel 
information and interference for MPI cancellation. 
Computer simulation results are given to show that it 
has much better performance than the maximum ratio 
combining scheme in different scenarios. In addition 
to MPI cancellation, we have also investigated 
resource allocation and cross-layer design methods for 
multiuser OFDM systems. It is expected that we can 
have some results of these works shortly. 
Keywords: Cross-layer design; multiple-pulse 
interference (MPI); parallel interference cancellation 
(PIC); OFDM; pulse shape modulation (PSM); 
resource allocation; ultra-wideband (UWB) 
technology. 
二、緣由與目的 
Ultra-wideband (UWB) technology has several 
important applications, including ground penetrating 
radar, image processing, and short range 
communications [1]. After the Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) allocated 7.5 
GHz of spectrum for unlicensed use of ultra-wideband 
devices in the 3.1 to 10.6 GHz frequency band [2], 
UWB technology has attracted more and more 
interests. 
Impulse radio is one of the common signal types 
for UWB systems [3], where short pulses are directly 
radiated to the air. Using short pulses for transmission 
has some advantages. For example, the power 
spectrum density of the pulse spreads the energy very 
thinly over several GHz, and it does not interfere with 
other narrowband signals. Also, the system is robust 
to multipath fading environments because its high 
resolution channel supplies many multipath 
components as a resource for RAKE receivers. For 
efficient transmission, a variety of modulation 
methods can be employed for UWB systems, where 
pulse position modulation (PPM) [4] is one of the 
most popular schemes developed to date. A PPM 
UWB system transmits only one pulse in a frame time 
(or pulse repetition time). In order to achieve higher 
data rates, we must shorten the frame time for the 
system. However, this will increase the 
implementation complexity of the transceiver, and the 
corresponding timing acquisition will become very 
difficult to handle. In contrast, with pulse shape 
modulation (PSM) [5] for UWB systems, we can 
increase the data rate without shortening the frame 
time by transmitting several orthogonal pulses (each 
for one data bit) within the same frame time. One 
major problem associated with PSM is that the 
orthogonality among pulses would be destroyed in 
multipath environments. This may cause a multiple-
pulse interference (MPI) problem and limit the 
capacity of a PSM UWB system. 
In this report, an interference cancellation scheme 
is proposed to alleviate the MPI problem in PSM 
UWB systems. The proposed method is similar to 
parallel interference cancellation (PIC) for code-
division multiple-access (CDMA) systems [6]. It 
makes use of a specific training sequence structure to 
estimate the channel information as well as the 
interference among all orthogonal pulses first, and 
then cancel all the interference (i.e., MPI) from the

that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce MPI

3.2 PIC-BASED MPI CANCELLATION 
3.2.1 The Conventional PIC Technique 
The PIC technique had been proposed to reduce 
multiple access interference (MAI) for CDMA systems 
[6]. One advantage of this technique is its ease of 
implementation, as compared with other linear 
multiuser detectors such as minimum mean square 
error detectors and decorrelator detectors. The concept 
of PIC is to treat the received signal as a resource for 
reconstructing MAI and then cancel it from the 
received signal. 
To achieve better performance, multistage PIC is 
usually considered for CDMA systems. At the sth 
interference cancellation (IC) stage, the reconstructed 
MAI of the kth bit for the vth user can be written as

where Nc is the processing gain, Nu is the number of 
users, an is the amplitude of the nth user, ( )ˆ snb [k] is the 
kth estimated bit for the nth user, and cn[i] is the ith 
chip of the spreading code for the nth user. After 
reconstructing MAI, the decision of the kth bit for the 
vth user is made by 
 ( ) [ ] ( ) [ ]( )ˆ ˆsgns sTv v k vb k I k= −c p                 (18) 
where pk is the received signal vector corresponding to 
the kth bit, vc  is the spreading code vector for the vth 
user, and sgn(•) is the sign function. Note that the 
elements of pk and vc  are in chip level, and the initial 
decisions (prior to the first IC stage) of the kth bit for 
all users are as follows: 
( ) [ ] ( )0ˆ sgn ,   0,  1,  ...,  1Tn v k ub k n N= = −c p .       (19) 
The PIC technique has low complexity and can 
effectively suppress MAI. Based on the concept of PIC, 
we will design a similar scheme to reduce MPI for 
PSM UWB systems in the next subsection. 
3.2.2 The Proposed Method 
Assume the guard-time Tg of the PSM UWB system 
is long enough and effectively works. Then the ISI 
term in (10) can be ignored and only the MPI problem 
needs to be considered. For the multiuser case, a PSM 
UWB system distinguishes the users by orthogonal 
pulses. So the corresponding MPI problem is similar to 
the MAI problem of CDMA systems. Following the 
conventional PIC approach for MAI cancellation, we 
can derive a scheme to reconstruct MPI for the desired 
user from the received signal and then cancel the MPI 
estimate from the received signal.  
To reconstruct MPI, we design a special training 
sequence structure as shown in Fig. 2 for estimation of 
the equivalent channel impulse response

nth pulse (used for the nth user) received at the mth 
matched filter. The sequence ωn in Fig. 2 is modulated 
by the orthogonal pulse pn(t) to estimate gn,m for 
reconstructing the interference among different pulses. 
order. This implies that we can get throughput 
increment without degrading the system performance 
significantly by appropriately increasing the 
modulation order of a PSM UWB system. It should 
also be noted that, the higher the modulation order, the 
more complexity the transceiver will involve. 
Therefore, we need to choose the modulation order 
properly such that the BER performance, the 
throughput rate, and the transceiver’s complexity can 
be balanced. Part of this work has been accepted for 
presentation in the 2006 International Wireless 
Communications and Mobile Computing Conference 
(IWCMC 2006), Vancouver, Canada, July 2006. In 
addition to PIC-based interference cancellation, we 
have also investigated resource allocation and cross-
layer design methods for multiuser OFDM systems. It 
is expected that we can have some results of these 
works shortly.

A. The Training Sequence 
     The proposed scheme is developed based on the training 
sequence described in Fig. 2. The autocorrelation function of a 
m-sequence is periodic and two-valued. For a bipolar 
m-sequence bP=[b(0), b(1), …, b(Pí1)], where each sample 
within the sequence is either +1 or í1, its autocorrelation 
function can be shown to be

where the notation ((⋅))P represents the operation of modulo P.
Assuming M1 and M2 represent the lengths of the cyclic prefix 
and postfix respectively, the relation b(n)=b(n+P) holds for 
n=íM1, íM1+1, …, M2í1. A reasonable constrain is made that 
both the lengths of the cyclic extensions are chosen to be longer 
than the number of effective taps of the sample-spaced CIR, 
which is denoted by hL=[h(0), h(1), …, h(Lí1)]. 
B. The Correlator Output 
Due to the cyclic extensions attached, part of the received 
training sequence can be modeled as the cyclic convolution of 
the CIR and the m-sequence. For time indexes n=íM1+Lí1, 
íM1+L, …, P+M2í1, it can be expressed as

the average total power of the channel taps be unity to ensure 
the same received power. By analyzing the distribution of the

III. SIMULATION RESULTS
     The proposed joint time synchronization and channel 
estimation scheme and a previous approach [8] are evaluated 
under 10-path Rayleigh and Ricean fading channels where part 
of their average power profile is illustrated in TABLE II. The 
Rayleigh fading channel model has been discussed in detail in 
[8].

An OFDM packet is composed of a training sequence 
followed by several OFDM data symbols. The structure of 
OFDM data symbols within the transmitted packet followed the 
same specifications described in [1]. A CFO, which is 
uniformly distributed within 0.5± subcarrier spacing, is also 
introduced independently from one packet to another. During 
our simulations, the modulatable orthogonal sequence [9] has 
been adopted to form the training sequence structure described 
in Fig. 1. The corresponding parameters were chosen as (M1, P,
M2)=(18, 64, 17). It should be noted that the length of a 
modulatable orthogonal sequence should be the square of a 
natural number. A primitive polynomial of degree 6 (1+D+D6)
had also been adopted to generate a m-sequence with period 
26í1. The parameters (M1, P, M2)=(18, 63, 18) were chosen to 
form the training sequence described in Fig. 2. 
The proposed scheme and a conventional one [8] are 
evaluated in several aspects. The results of the probability of 
perfect time synchronization are illustrated in TABLE III. 
Since the proposed scheme utilizes an optimized threshold, it 
has the highest probability of perfect time synchronization 
among all the cases considered. For the two different channel 
conditions, where the values of 20σ are 0.6321 and 0.2325 
respectively, the proposed scheme leads to comparable results 
as SNR increases. On the contrary, the conventional scheme 
can perform very differently even the same alpha is adopted. 
Once a particular alpha has been chosen, it remains fixed, 
which leads to insignificant performance gain as SNR 
increases.

The bit-error-rate (BER) performances of the proposed 
scheme and the conventional one [8] are demonstrated in Fig. 5. 
The proposed scheme outperforms the conventional one due to 
the utilization of the optimal threshold, which adapts itself to 
the SNR, the period of the m-sequence, and the channel 
characteristics. Again, the proposed scheme is much more 
robust against channel changes comparing to the conventional 
one. Although better BER results could be obtained by 
substituting other values of alpha in the conventional scheme, 
the extensive trial and error process will be time-consuming 
and therefore unrealistic. The ultimate BER bound provided 
that the receiver is able to acquire the exact knowledge of 
symbol timing, CFO, and CIR is also illustrated as a reference. 
The BER performances of some variations of the proposed 
scheme are demonstrated in Fig. 6. Recall that ȕopt is a function 
of P, SNR, and 20σ . Since P should be known to the receiver 
and SNR can be constantly monitored by SNR estimation 
algorithms, ȕopt can be determined if 20σ  is also available to the 
receiver. In Fig. 3, we have shown that different values of 
2
0σ lead to similar values of ȕopt. Consequently, if the value 
of 20σ is unavailable, the threshold in (8) will be calculated by 
assuming 20 0.5σ = . Simulation results show that the proposed 
scheme leads to similar results with or without knowing the 
actual value of 20σ . With proper CFO estimation and 
compensation, which can be done by CP, the proposed scheme 
leads to similar results as compared to the case without any 
CFO. In other words, the effect of residual CFO is insignificant 
to the proposed scheme. Furthermore, although the optimal 
threshold is derived from Rayleigh fading channels, it can be 
utilized to assist joint time synchronization and channel 
estimation in Ricean fading channels as well. 
IV. CONCLUSIONS
We have presented a new joint time synchronization and 
channel estimation scheme based on m-sequences. The 
proposed scheme relies on an optimal threshold, which adapts 
itself to the SNR, the period of the m-sequence, and the channel 
characteristics, to ensure good performance. The proposed 
scheme outperforms a conventional scheme [8] and involves 
lower complexity.

Abstract—Multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing 
(MU-OFDM) is a promising technique for future wide-area 
mobile communications, which can provide scalable high data 
rate transmission. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity 
iterative power allocation algorithm with proportional rate 
constraints. After appropriate subcarrier allocation with equal 
power distribution, the proposed algorithm can achieve 
proportional rates among users in a few iterations by 
determining each user’s power subject to the rate constraints and 
then equally distributing it to the corresponding subcarriers. 
Simulation results show that, for the equal rate case, the 
proposed approach achieves more than 98% of the minimum 
user’s capacity provided by a near-optimal power allocation 
algorithm when the number of subcarriers is 128. When the 
number of subcarriers increases to 1024, the proposed method 
approaches the optimal performance.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MU-
OFDM), or OFDM access (OFDMA), is a modulation and 
multiple-access technique for high data rate transmission. It 
has been considered as one of the promising techniques for 
next-generation wireless communication systems [1], and has 
been adopted in the IEEE 802.16e standard [2]. 
Due to the inherent flexibility of OFDM in power loading 
across the subcarriers, the resource allocation, which involves 
subcarrier and power allocation, is an active area of research in 
recent years. An efficient resource allocation algorithm can 
improve the spectral efficiency and provide good quality of 
service [3]. There are two equivalent optimization problem 
formulations for resource allocation [4]; one is margin adaptive 
(MA) and the other is rate adaptive (RA). The MA formulation 
is to do subcarrier and power allocation in a way that the total 
power required is minimized, with a constraint on the users’ 
data rates or bit error rates. In contrast, the RA formulation is to 
maximize each user’s error free data rate with a total transmit 
power constraint. It has turned out that the optimal subcarrier 
and power allocation in an OFDMA system can be 
simultaneously done with linear complexity on the order of  the 
number of subcarriers times the number of users by applying 
Lagrange dual decomposition [5], [6]. 
In this paper, we concentrate on the RA optimization 
techniques with additional proportional rate constraints. In [7], 
the sum capacity without proportional rate constraints was 
proved to be maximum when the power was allocated across 
subcarriers by the water-filling algorithm. The RA 
optimization method described in [8] (referred to as the RC 
algorithm) maximized the minimum user’s capacity, which 
can be regarded as a special case of the proportional rate 
constraints problem. The study in [9] (referred to as the SAE 
algorithm) focused on maximizing the sum capacity subject to 
the proportional rate constraints of users’ data rates. This 
approach involves solving a set of nonlinear equations to get 
the power distribution among users under a high channel-to-
noise ratio (CNR) assumption and needs to calculate some 
parameters in advance, with complexity proportional to the 
number of subcarriers. Then the greedy water-filling algorithm 
is used for power distribution among subcarriers of each user. 
Although the SAE algorithm achieves near-optimum 
performance, its computational complexity is pretty high. In 
[10], Wong et al. proposed an algorithm which is simpler than 
the SAE algorithm but the proportional rate constraints are not 
strictly enforced. 
In this paper, we develop a low-complexity iterative power 
allocation algorithm to achieve proportional rates among users. 
Instead of solving the nonlinear equations in [9], the total 
available power for each user is updated iteratively such that 
the corresponding capacities approach the proportional rate 
constraints. Based on rough resource allocation by the RC 
algorithm with the proportional rate constraints [9], the desired 
rate proportionality can be fulfilled by the proposed algorithm 
in just a few iterations and the complexity required is 
proportional to the number of users. Instead of using the 
complicated greedy water-filling algorithm for power 
distribution among subcarriers of each user, the proposed 
algorithm equally distributes the power to all subcarriers of 
each user, which involves much lower complexity. Simulation 
results show that the proposed approach meets reasonable 
proportional rate constraints in comparison with the SAE 
algorithm when the number of subcarriers is 128. When the 
number of subcarriers increases to 1024, the proposed method 
even outperforms the SAE algorithm due to the fact that the 
high CNR assumption in some subcarriers is not held. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the 
MU-OFDM system model and formulates resource allocation 
as an RA optimization problem. In Section III, the near-optimal

From the above derivations, there are two issues needed to 
be investigated: 1) Does ( ) ( )| |m mk kP P∆   always hold?; 2) Is the 
algorithm convergent when the power is updated continuously? 
A. Condition for the Approximation 
Assume that ( )mα  is the step size at the mth iteration of the 
power allocation algorithm and ( )mp  is a K×1 column vector 
with ith element ( ) ( )m mi iP P∆ . When ( ) ( )| |m mk kP P∆ / , ( )mα  can 
be designed such that this approximation is held. Thus, the 
updated power equation for user k becomes ( 1) ( )m mk kP P
+
= +  
( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )(1 )m m m m m mk k k kP P P Pα α∆ = + ∆ , where 
( ) ( )0.4 || ||m mα
∞
= p . 
It means that ( )mα  makes ( ) ( )m mk kP P∆  be normalized by their 
maximum absolute value and then multiply 0.4. This value, 0.4, 
is chosen such that 80% approximation is attained, i.e., 
| [ ln(1 )] ln(1 ) | 0.2x x x− + + ≈ , and provides a good tradeoff 
between accuracy and convergence speed. By multiplying ( )mα , 
the desired approximation is held and the above derivations can 
iteratively update the power for all users. 
B. Convergence of the Proposed Algorithm 
Proposition: With the condition in the last subsection, the 
proposed algorithm is convergent provided ( )mα  satisfies  
( )0 2mα< < , 0,1, 2,...m = . 
Proof: With (7), (9), (14), and the condition in the last 
subsection, the capacity for user k at the (m+1)th iteration is 
( 1) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )( )m m m m m m mk k k k k kR R R R R Rα α
+
′≈ + ∆ = + −  (15) 
Defining an error factor ( 1) ( 1)m mk k ku R R
+ +
′= −  and subtracting kR′  
from both sides of (15), yields 
( 1) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )(1 )m m m m m mk k k ku u u uα α
+
≈ − = −    (16) 
Proving that the proposed algorithm converges to kR′ , reduces 
to proving that the error factor ( 1)mku
+  converges to zero. Using 
repeated substitution, (16) can be expressed as ( 1)mku
+
≈  
( ) (0)
0
(1 )m i ki uα= −∏ . Consequently, ( 1)lim 0mkm u +→∞ →  provided 
( )|1 | 1iα− < , 0,1,...,i m=  . That is, ( )0 2mα< < , 0,1, 2,...m = . ■ 
With this proposition and ( ) ( )0.4 || ||m mα
∞
= p  when 
( ) ( )| |m mk kP P∆ / , the step size at the mth iteration can be 
determined as 
( ) ( )min(0.4 || || ,1)m mα
∞
= p     (17) 
since ( ) ( )| |m mk kP P∆   is held when ( )0.4 || || 1m ∞ >p . 
C. Termination of the Iteration 
From [9], a quantity, average rate constraint deviation 
(RCD), to measure how well the rate constraints are satisfied 
can be defined as

when ( ) (0)0.1mi iΦ < Φ . That is, the RCD of the proposed 
algorithm is about a tenth of the RCD of the RC algorithm.
