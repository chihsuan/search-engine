Introduction 
 
In this report, we will show the results of NSC project this year, which includes 
the bi-layered metallic wire-grid polarizers and the inserted Cu mesh electrodes, 
separately. 
The bi-layered metallic wire-grid polarizers 
Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) proposed by Chou et al. in 1995 has been 
considered as one of the most promising techniques in fabricating nano-scale patterns 
with high throughput, low cost and good fidelity [1, 2]. NIL has also been applied in a 
broad range of optical systems, such as WGPs [3-5], transparent metal electrodes for 
organic solar cells [6] and organic light-emitting diodes [7]. 
Here, we proposes an efficient process for fabricating bi-layered metallic wire- 
grid polarizers (WGP), which consist of a metallic (Aluminum) layer on the top and a 
dielectric (PMMA) layer at the bottom. The proposed architecture was fabricated 
from the insertion structure, which was accomplished through only three steps, i.e., 
nanoimprint, aluminum deposition and chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), to 
embed the Al wire grating into PMMA substrate. By taking the advantage of the 
characteristic of the insertion structure, this technique fabricated PMMA wires with 
O2 plasma etching by employing the nano-scale Al wire gratings as a mask to achieve 
bi-layered structures. The proposed bi-layered structures of metallic WGP can achieve 
superior optical performance, which will be demonstrated in this work. 
The inserted Cu mesh electrodes 
Organic solar cells (OSCs) represent a promising energy-conversion technology 
for clean and carbon-neutral energy production [8, 9]. Touch panels, which are 
assembled in the prevailing smart phones, provide user-friendly and intuitive 
operation [10]. Indium Tin oxide (ITO) substrates have been built on OSCs and touch 
panels because of being able to offer both optical transparency and electrical 
conductivity. However, ITO is not the best material for these particular applications 
due to its high cost, chemical [11] and mechanical [12] property. 
Therefore, we proposed an efficient process, with high throughput, for 
manufacturing stable insertion structures inside PMMA substrates through only three 
steps, i.e., nanoimprint, metal deposition and burnishing process. The insertion 
structures with potential applications in transparent metal electrodes possesses the 
 3 
stresses during packaging process or transportation. This construction might require 
the thin layer for protection; nevertheless, it could hinder the optical transmittance and 
even increase the complexity of fabrication process. 
Purpose 
The bi-layered metallic wire-grid polarizers 
Herein, we provide an efficient process to construct bi-layered structures by 
merely O2 plasma etching with the Al wire gratings as a mask. In this process, the 
bi-layered structure is realized from insertion structure [23], which can be efficiently 
accomplished by only three steps, i.e., nanoimprint, aluminum deposition and CMP 
technique.  
In addition, the bi-layered structure can achieve higher optical performance, such 
as extinction ratio, than the protrusion structure with the same linewidth, pitch and 
height of Al wire gratings by 2.2 times between 0 degree to 40 degrees of incident 
angle at a wavelength of 650 nm of incident light in optical measurement. Because 
this architecture features an Al layer on the top of a dielectric one, it is intended to be 
applied for fabricating metallic wire gratings of bi-layered structure on the PMMA or 
PET as a polarizer of flexible display devices. Accordingly, the fabricated device with 
bi-layered structures has potential to be utilized in polarizers, polarization beam 
splitters and optical isolators [24, 25]. 
The inserted Cu mesh electrodes 
In this work, we report on an effective process, includes NIL, metal deposition 
and burnishing process, and a proposed insertion structure [23, 26], lacks for the 
protective layer, to achieve high transparency metal wire grid electrodes for OSC and 
touch panel applications. The inserted high transparency metal electrodes have several 
advantages over other highly transparent electrodes including ITO. Firstly, the work 
function of nanopatterned transparent metal electrodes can be easily tuned by 
choosing different metal materials, which allows systematic studies of the effect that 
the electrode work function has on the device performance. Secondly, a high electrical 
conductivity can be achieved without seriously compromising the transparency [27]. 
Thirdly, the light absorption and the resulting power conversion efficiency of OSCs 
can possibly be increased by means of light trapping phenomena that are induced by 
the grating structure [28–31]. Lastly, OSCs and touch panels with inserted TME could 
be realized at a low cost and a high throughput by using the effective process for 
offering flatly finished surface for subsequent processes, such as sealing and 
 5 
In this study, Si mold is fabricated by laser interference lithography with 
nano-scale wire gratings of 100 nm in linewidth, 240 nm in pitch and 150 nm in 
height, as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 3 illustrates the manufacturing process of the insertion 
structure, which consists of nanoimprint, Al thin film deposition and CMP process. 
First, a self-developed thermal nanoimprint machine was used to implement the 
nanoimprint process under the designed imprint conditions for pattern transfer.

Fig. 4 explains process conditions of temperature and pressure during 
nanoimprint. First, the imprint temperature and pressure were set to be 120 ℃ and 
12.5 MPa, respectively, and the imprint period was about 360 sec. Secondly, the 
imprinted devices were cooled down to room temperature and the imprint pressure 
was held for 60 sec in order to obtain better pattern transfer of nano-scale wire 
gratings on PMMA substrate. Thirdly, DC sputtering was utilized to deposit Al thin 
film on patterned PMMA substrate with 300 nm in height, which is designed higher

the insertion structure with Al wire gratings. The precision lapping and polishing 
machine (manufactured by Mabuchi S & T Inc.) was modified as the CMP equipment. 
The schematic setup of CMP process is illustrated in Fig. 5. The specimen with 
insertion structures was polished on a flannelette polishing plate. The slurry was 
composed of alumina as abrasives and H2O2 as an oxidizer. The average of abrasive 
grits of CMP slurry was around 30-50 nm. Table 1 shows the CMP process parameters 
used in this experiment, which was completed within 30 seconds. The dimensions of 
the finished insertion structure after CMP process with Al wire gratings are 100 nm in 
linewidth, 240 nm in pitch and 150 nm in height. 
Table 1 Processing parameters of CMP 
 
Then, we utilized O2 plasma etching treatment to remove the PMMA in the 
insertion structures to construct bi-layered structures by using Al wire gratings as a 
mask. The process flow is shown in Fig. 6. Table 2 summarizes the O2 plasma etching 
process parameters used in this experiment. The etching time with 3 levels were 
selected at 3.5, 4.5 and 5.5 min. Other process parameters including power, O2 flow 
rate and Ar2 flow rate were fixed for all the tests.

recipes of Cu e-gun evaporation are deposition rate at 4 A/sec, room temperature at 25 
℃, and background pressure at 6×10-6 Torr.

Finally, the residual layer of Cu thin film was removed by burnishing process for 
fabricating the inserted Cu mesh electrode. The schematic setup of burnishing process 
is illustrated in Fig. 9. The specimen was polished on a flannelette polishing pad, 
which the product name is BC2-8008 from PACE Technologies, with filtered pure 
water as slurry. The average feature size of soft pile on the flannelette polishing pad 
was around 10 to 30 μm. Table 3 shows the process parameters of burnishing process 
used in this experiment, which was completed within 10 seconds.

defined as the ratio of transmittance of P-polarization to that of S-polarization. In this 
study, we measured the optical characteristics of the bi-layered structures with wire 
gratings 100 nm in linewidth, 240 nm in pitch, and 300 nm in total height, i.e., 150 
nm each for Al and PMMA wire gratings, by using an incident light with a 
wavelength of 650 nm.  
Fig. 14 shows the optical measurement setup of the insertion structures based on 
Malus’s law [38]. We rotated the insertion structure at 0 and 90 degrees, respectively, 
for optical detection. The detector measured the intensity of transmitted light at both 
degrees with P/S polarization. To divide the measured values of P-polarization by 
S-polarization attains the value of extinction ratio. 
 
Fig. 14. Schematic diagram of optical measurement setup 
Fig. 15 shows the measurement results for two different types of nanopatterns of 
Al wire gratings. The ER of bi-layered structures, with 100 nm in linewidth, 240 nm 
in pitch and 300 nm in total height, i.e., 150 nm each for Al and PMMA wire gratings, 
is conspicuously higher than the companion protrusion structures with the same 
linewidth, pitch and height of Al wire gratings. The result shows that the largest ER of 
the proposed architecture indicated with blue curve is over 1750.3 at 40 degrees of an 
incident angle and the average ER of 497 from 0 degree to 40 degrees of incident 
angles in this optical experiment. When the incident angle surpasses 40 degrees, the 
light can’t pass through the polarizer because of total internal reflection (TIR) [39]. 
The curves in the figure should be the higher the better for the ER from 0 to 40 
degrees of incident angles. In practice, the higher ER will raise the contrast of LCD 
[40]. 
 15 
Besides, the brightness gain of the proposed bi-layered structures is 1.18, which 
is better than the protrusion structures of 1.12, in a wavelength of 650 nm of incident 
light of back-light unit. The definition of brightness gain is given as the ratio of 
transmittance of P-polarization and recycled transmittance of P-polarization of 
back-light unit to the transmittance of P-polarization. 
The inserted Cu mesh electrodes 
In burnishing process, the function of soft piles of the flannelette polishing pad is 
similar to the abrasive particles in CMP process [41]. It can be simplified by a single 
pile model as illustrated in Fig. 17. According to the geometry, the indentation depth t 
for a single pile can be calculated and approximated as: 
𝑆 = √
𝐷2
4
− ( 
𝐷
2
− 𝑡)2 ≅ √𝐷𝑡 
where S is semi-width of a single abrasive (pile) indentation as shown in Fig. 17. The 
pile diameter D is about 10 to 30μm in the burnishing process, while the indentation 
depth by the single pile is within a hundred nanometers. The equation indicates that 
the larger down pressure will increase the deeper indentation depth and could result in 
the worse surface roughness [32]. Herein, controlling the appropriate down pressure is 
very crucial for obtaining the flat surface of inserted Cu mesh electrode. A flatly 
finished surface of insertion structure is contributive to its optical performance, 
sealing and packaging in devices [26].

The finished surface area of inserted Cu mesh electrode after thermal 
nanoimprint and burnishing process was about 0.5×0.5 cm

. We randomly chose four 
areas, 10.0 × 10.0 μm2 each, for AFM analysis. Fig. 19 shows good uniformity of 
area-1 surface. The roughness of four areas ranges from 1.856 nm to 2.567 nm, which 
are close to the bare PMMA surface as shown in Table 4. This result shows that the 
process can fabricate the embedded structure with flat surfaces.

of the nano-scale Al wire gratings as a mask to achieve bi-layered structures. We can 
accomplish the desirable bi-layered structures with power at 150 W, O2 flow rate at 30 
sccm, Ar2 flow rate at 10 sccm and the etching time at 3.5 min in O2 plasma etching 
treatment. The bi-layered structures can achieve higher optical performance, such as 
extinction ratio, than the companion protrusion structures with the same linewidth, 
pitch and height of Al wire gratings by 2.2 times between 0 degree to 40 degrees of 
incident angle at a wavelength of 650 nm of incident light in optical measurement. 
Also, in a wavelength of 650 nm of incident light of back-light unit, the brightness 
gain of the proposed bi-layered structures is 1.18, which is better than the protrusion 
structures of 1.12. Furthermore, we have observed that the deeper PMMA wire 
gratings of bi-layered structures can’t acquire the higher extinction ratio, because of 
the increase of the P-polarization as well as the S-polarization. Thus, it is very crucial 
to harness the etched depth of PMMA wire gratings in O2 plasma etching process.  
The inserted Cu mesh electrodes 
In this paper, we demonstrated that Cu mesh electrode with insertion structures 
after thermal nanoimprint and burnishing process enabled to exploit in transparent 
metal electrode through simulation and measurement. The finished Cu mesh electrode 
acquired average optical transmittance of 84.6 % in visible regime and the sheet 
resistance is 26.78 Ω/□. We are able to improve both the optical transmittance and 
electrical performance of Cu mesh electrode by adjusting the linewidth and polished 
depth of the insertion structures. The inserted Cu mesh electrode could offer the flat 
surface for sealing and assembling in organic solar cell or touch panel. Through the 
effective process and inexpensive Cu, we could curtail the cost for manufacturing 
transparent metal electrode.

奈米壓印成型的幾何形狀與表面粗度對偏光元件的光穿透率及消光比有相當大的影響，但是如何定
義其間的關係，奈米結構幾何形狀與表面粗度的精密量測即相當的重要。本人在此一研討會中已請
教相關教授，並請他們協助解決本人所遇到的瓶頸。 
最後還是要感謝國科會的經費補助，使本人及其他教授、研究機構同仁及研究生得以接觸到最
快最新的資訊，讓大家的研究均能快速的開展而不致落後。

一、參加會議經過 
國際微微米與奈米工程研討會舉辦至今已 37 屆了，此一研討會歷年來均在歐洲國家輪流舉行，
由於近年來因歐盟計畫大力支持微奈米工程技術的研發，故相關的論文水準相當高，且由於廠商的
大力參與及贊助，使本研討會更具意義。本人實驗室從 6 年前即開始參加這個研討會，今年更是針
對本研討會做了更豐富的安排。我們此次有四位教授同行，9 月 17 日晚間出發，到達法蘭克福機
場後，搭乘德國著名的 ICE高速列車轉往Kassel，在這裡Kassel University的 Institute of Nanostructure 
Technologies and Analytics 是我們的第一個訪問單位，一行人於 19 日早上 8 點 30 分提前到達該研
究中心後，即開始進行介紹、簡報、參觀與討論，由該研究所所長 Prof. Hartmut Hillmer 主持，一
直到下午 3 點鐘才結束。會中主要是了解雙方的研究專長、經驗、成果及未來的研發方向，並約定
好共同向國科會提出研究計畫。 
19 日下午即搭 ICE 列車趕往會議地點柏林，到達時已經晚上 9 點了。20 日早上即赴會場註冊開
始參加研討會，參觀所有的海報展示與廠商攤位，並於 22 日晚間參加該研討會的晚宴。23 日即搭
車從柏林出發到達漢諾威參觀世界最大的工具機展(AMO)，由於本人亦從事液靜壓軸承的研究，此
為工具機最重要的關鍵零組件之一，故一到達現場就去參觀 Hypostatic 公司的展示廠，並了解他們
的產品現況。接著去參觀我國上銀公司與德國 DMG 公司的展示攤位，24 日早上即赴法蘭克福機
場附近的汽車展，一直到 12 點鐘離開搭機回國，全程相當豐富且緊湊。 
二、與會心得 
本研討會今年的註冊人數有 772 位，約有 660 篇論文分成五個主題：Lithography and Systems 
(LITH) 、 Nanodevices/Nanoelectronics (NANO) 、  Nanophotonics/Optics (PHOT) 、 Micro- and 
Nanoengineering (MEMS) 及 Life Sciences (LIFE)。這些論文來自於世界 39 個國家，其中歐洲為 364
篇、亞洲 257、美國 36 篇、以及澳洲及紐西蘭 8 篇。本次共有 150 篇論文以口頭報告，432 篇為海
報展示。 
本次大會共有 6 場 Plenary Speech 及 24 場 Invited Speech。6 場 Plenary Speech 分別為：(1) Luc Van 
den hove, IMEC, Leuven/Belgium, “Semiconductors: core of a sustainable amazing world,” (2) Hiroyuki 
Fujita, CIRMM, IIS, University of Tokyo/Japan, “MENS/NEMS for Nano and Bio Technologies,” (3) 
Andres Tunnermann, Fraunhofer Institute IOF, Jena/Germany, “Micro and nanostructures for 
multichannel imaging – small lenses go big,” (4) Michelle Y. Simmons, Centre of Excellence for 
Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, School of Physics, University of New South 
Wales/Australia, “Atomically Precise Silicon Devices in all Three Dimensions,” (5) C. Grant Willson, 
University of Texas, Austin, Department of Chemical Engineering, Texas/U. S. A. “The race to Higher 
resolution: It’s not over yet!” (6) Viola Vogel, Department of Materials, ETH Zurich/Switzerland, ”How 
Cells Exploit the Nanomechanics of Proteins.” 
參加學術研討會的主要目的在於了解同一領域學者專家的研究內容、進度及未來方向，並希望
  
國科會補助專題研究計畫項下出席國際學術會議心得報告 
                                     日期：100 年 10 月 18 日
