1Derivation of Modified Reynolds Equation A Porous Media Model with Effects of
Electrokinetics
Abstract
A lubrication theory that includes the effects of electrokinetics and surface micro structure is
developed. Porous layers attached to the impermeable substrate are used to model the
microstructure on bearing surfaces. The modification of electrical body force on the
Brinkman-
the porous media and fluid film region, respectively. The stress jump boundary conditions
at the porous media/fluid film interface and effects of viscous shear and electric double
layer (EDL) are also considered in deriving the modified Reynolds equation. Under the
usual assumptions of lubrication and Debye-Hückel approximation for low surface potential,
the velocity distributions, apparent viscosity and modified Reynolds equation are then
derived. The considerations of EDL near the interface and the charge density of the flow
in the porous media increase the apparent viscosity. The existence of porous film also
increases the apparent viscosity as well. Both effects are important for flow within micro
spacing and lubrication problems. The apparent viscosity is expressed explicitly as
functions of the Debye length, the electro-viscosity, the charge density, the stress jump
parameter, and the porous parameters (permeability, porosity, porous film thickness). The
apparent viscosity and the performance of 1-D slider bearings are analyzed and discussed.
The results show that the apparent viscosity and the load capacity increase as the
permeability decreases, stress jump parameter decreases, or charge density increases, or
decrease in inverse Debye length, or decreases in porosity.

film is no more uniform.
modified by adding the Brinkman term to account for the viscous shear effects in thin
porous film [13]. Moreover, the stress jump boundary conditions on the porous
media/fluid film interface are also considered to account for the excess viscous stress with
stress jump parameters ranges from -1 to 1.47 [16]. However, the electrokinetic effects
were not considered in the porous lubrication modeling.
Electrokinetic phenomena occur when a charged surface is brought into contact with an
ionic liquid. The counter-ions in the liquid are attracted by the charged wall. A diffuse
electric double layer (EDL) forms away from the wall as the concentration of counter ions
decreases away from the wall. The effect of EDL as well as the Helmholtz-
was introduced to derive the modified Reynolds equation in thin
film lubrication theory [20-23]. A potential field (streaming potential) is then generated as
the counter-ions are moving downstream by pressure gradient. Therefore, an electrokinetic
force, that opposes the primary fluid flow, increases the flow resistance and thus the
electro-viscous effect. The electro-viscosity due to the existence of EDL on the
liquid/solid interface changes the rheology of the thin lubricating film. The concept of
apparent viscosity, which is defined as the combination of the electro-viscosity and the
viscosity of bulk fluid can be regarded as an equivalent (or apparent) viscosity, was
proposed and measured experimentally in micro-channels or capillaries [1, 2]. The
electro-viscosity depends on the Debye length, the material of lubricating surfaces, the ionic
concentration, the dielectric constant and the conductivity of liquid. Near the Debye
52. Derivation
In a lubrication problem with EDL effects considered, the microstructure of the lubricating
surfaces is modeled as a thin isotropic porous-film press-fitted in the impermeable substrate.
The two surfaces are sliding at dimensionless velocities ( 1 1,u v ) and ( 2 2,u v ), and the film
has an arbitrary two-dimensional shape, ( , , )h h x y t . The variation of the pressure
distribution (p) across the porous film is negligible as the porous film thickness is smaller
than the thickness of the lubrication film. However, the velocity distribution across the
porous film can not be modeled as uniform (like Darcy law) as the porous film is thin and
the existence of viscous and EDL effects. In the following derivation, the properties of
fluid in the two porous film are assumed to have constant permeability ( 1k and 2k ),
constant charge density ( 1e and 2e ), and constant effective viscosity of fluid in the
permeable matrix ( 1 and 2 ). In the pure flow region, there exist a constant inverse
Debye length and a constant viscosity . Under the usual assumptions of lubrication
theory (negligible inertia effects, small film thickness and no variation of pressure across the
film thickness), the three regions of the flow are modeling by the Stokes equation with
electrical body force in pure flow region and the extended Brinkman equation with electrical
body force in the porous regions. In addition, the stress jump boundary condition, which is
suggested by Ochoa-Tapia and Whitaker [15, 16] by the sophisticated volume averaging
technique), is used on the porous media/fluid film interface.
The modeling of flow in the three regions is shown as in shown in Fig.1, i.e.

Results and Discussion
The present model contains seven material properties: (1) permeability ( iK ), (2)
viscosity ratio ( 2 1i i/ ), (3) stress jump parameter ( i ), (4) solution charge density ( ei ),
(5) Debye length ( 1- ), (6) electro-viscosity ( e' ), and (7) porous thickness ( i ). For
simplicity, the assumptions of constant material properties and the same material properties
of the two surfaces ( 1 2 iK K K , 1 2= , 1 2 , 1 2e e e , 1 2 ) are
made. The effects of these seven parameters on the apparent viscosity ( a / ), interfacial
velocities ( piU ), velocity distributions (U ), and performances of 1-D wedge problems are
discussed.
Apparent Viscosity. The dependence of the apparent viscosity, a a= / , on the
permeability ( K ), viscosity ratio ( 2 ), stress jump parameter ( ), solution charge density
( e ), inverse Debye length ( ), sliding velocity ( 1U ), and porous film thickness ( 2 ) is
plotted as functions of dimensionless electro-viscosity as shown in Fig.2(a). The
dependence is computed by Eq.(33). Seven cases with 1 0.1 , 2 0U , and / -10dP dX
are listed in Table 1. Case A (with 0 01K . , 1 , 0 , 10e , 10 , 1 0U , and
2 =0.2) is defined as the basic case. All the other cases are compared with case A for
discussion. From case B, the change in sliding velocity doesn t affect the apparent
viscosity. From case C, a decrease in permeability makes the resistance to flow in porous
media increase, and thus increase the apparent viscosity. From case D, an increase in
viscosity ratio means the flow viscosity inside the porous media is increasing, and thus the
apparent viscosity is increasing. From case E, an increase in stress jump will increase the
15
slightly except for case F. The slightly increase in interfacial velocities as reference
electro-viscosity increases.

EFFECTS OF ELECTROKINETIC SLIP FLOW ON LUBRICATION THEORY
Wang-Long Li   Institute of Nanotechnology and Microsystems Engineering, National Cheng
Kung University, No.1 University Road, Tainan City, 701, TAIWAN
ABSTRACT
A lubrication theory that includes the effects of
electric double layer (EDL) and boundary slip is
developed.  Both effects are important in
microflow, and thus in lubrication problems. 
They have opposite effects on velocity
distributions between lubricating surfaces. 
Also, the velocity distribution induced by the
EDL stream potential (electro-viscous effect) is
affected by the boundary slip.  Under the usual
assumptions of lubrication and Debye-Hückel
approximation for low surface potential, the
Navier-Stokes equation with body force due to
the electrical potential as well as the widely
accepted Navier slip boundary conditions is
utilized on deriving the modified Reynolds
equation.  Effects of EDL and boundary slip
on the 1-D bearing performance are discussed
by solving the modified Reynolds equation
numerically.
INTRODUCTION
The existence of electric double layer (EDL) in
the interface between a liquid and a solid (ceramic)
surface changes the rheology of the thin lubricating
film (so called electro-viscosity).  The increase in
the apparent viscosity of water was found
experimentally [1-4] in micro-channels or capillaries. 
The effect of EDL was first introduced into thin film
lubrication theory by Bike and Prieve [5] and then by
Zhang and Umehara [6].  The
Helmholtz-Smoluchowski’s equation was used in the
derivation of the modified Reynolds equation.  Bai
and Huang [7] modified the potential distributions in
ref. [6] and found EDL has apparent effects on the
coefficient of friction. 
Elelctro-viscous effects on pressure-driven liquid
flow become important in recent development of
microchannels [8].  D. Q. Li [9] makes detail
reviews of EDL effects in microfluidics.  The EDL
effect in microchannel retards liquid flow and results
in a streaming potential.  The combination of the
electro-viscosity and the viscosity of bulk fluid can
be regarded as the equivalent (or apparent) viscosity. 
On the contrary, the velocity slip, which is found in
the development of microfluidic and MEMS devices,
dilutes the viscosity near the wall.  Detail reviews
about slip phenomena are shown in the articles by
Granick et al.[10] and Neto et al [11].  The widely
used Navier slip conditions ( s svη βσ≡ );are used by
Vinogradova [12] on the derivation of hydrodynamic
pressure, and the slip correction factors.  The slip
length (β) depends on the kind of material, fluids, the
contact angles or wettability between liquid and
solid interface, and flow velocities.
The EDL-induced electro-viscosity and the
slip-diluted viscosity are contraries.  The
electro-viscosity retards the flow and the slip
dilutes the viscosity near the boundaries. The
combined effects are discussed in
microchannels [13, 14].  They should be
important in small clearance, especially in
lubrication problems.  Also, due to the
sophisticate technique on surface treatment and
lubricant, we can control the surface status and
electro-viscosity of lubricant.  A lubrication
theory that contains the effects of electrokinetic
slip flow is necessary for the advancement of
science and technology. 
NOMENCLATURE
6apparent viscosity increases as '/eη η increases
or slip lengths decrease.  The electro-viscosity
comes from the EDL near the lubricating
surfaces.  It resists the flow near the
lubricating surface.  The opposite effect is the
slip lengths (
1 2,B B ) on the boundaries which
‘dilute’ the viscosity near the boundaries. 
Thus, the combined effects of EDL and velocity
slip near the lubricating surfaces affect the
apparent viscosity significantly.  As shown in
Fig.1(b), the dimensionless apparent viscosity
( /a aη η η= ) is plotted as functions of the
dimensionless reference electro-viscosity ( '/eη η )
for various combinations of dimensionless
inverse Debye lengths ( 0 'h κ ).  The Debye
length ( 1κ− ) increases as the vacuum
permittivity ( 0ε ) or the permittivity (ε )
increases.  As the Debye length is comparable
with the film thickness (small 0 'h κ ), the EDL
affects the apparent viscosity significantly.
In Fig.2, the load capacity of the present 1-D
case is plotted as functions of reference
electro-viscosity for various combination of slip
length on the lubricating surfaces.  Eq.(8) is
solved numerically by finite difference method. 
Smaller slip length results in larger resistance of
flow, and thus results in larger load capacity. 
The load capacities are almost the same at small
slip length (
1 2,B B )=(0.01, 0.03) and (0.03, 0.01),
i.e. (0.01,  0.03)W ≈ (0.03,  0.01)W .  However, the
discrepancies become significant as the slip
length (
1 2,B B ) increases further to (0.1, 0.3) and
(0.3, 0.1), i.e. (0.1,  0.3) (0.3,  0.1)W W> .  From
Eq.(8), the LHS comes from the Poiseuille flow,
and the RHS comes from the Couette flow. 
From Eq.(7), we have

From 1G , we have 1 1 2( ,  )G B B > 1 2 1( ,  )G B B if
2 1B B> .  In the present 1-D example, the
surface 1 is on the moving surface, and surface
2 is on the stationary surface.  More slip on
surface 1 (
1 0.3B = ) and lesser slip on surface 2
(
2 0.1B = ), will result in smaller 1G , and thus
results in smaller load capacity.  As surface 1
starts to move, the larger slip length on it make
the drawing flow decrease, and smaller Couette
flow.   On the contrary, more slip on
stationary surface 2 ( 2 0.3B = ) and lesser slip on
surface moving surface ( 1 0.1B = ), will result in
larger 1G , and thus results in larger load
capacity.  The smaller slip length on surface 1
make the drawing flow more effectively, and
the resistance near surface 2 also decrease for
larger slip length.  Thus, we have larger 1G
for the present case.  Thus we have the load
capacity follows
1 2 2 1( ,  ) ( ,  )W B B W B B> if 1 2B B< . 
The effects of slip lengths on the load capacity
are of more significance than those of reference
electro-viscosity.
CONCLUSION
A modified Reynolds equation, which includes
the effects of EDL and Navier slip, is derived.
The contrary effects of EDL and Navier slip on
the load capacities are discussed, and find
significant changes due to these two effects. 
More slip on surface 1 and lesser slip on surface
2, will result in smaller load capacity.
