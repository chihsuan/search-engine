development of miniature zoom optics. Currently, aspheric surfaces are widely employed in 
most optical designs for miniature zoom optics modules, but the tolerance of an opto-
mechanical system such as a zoom cam presents another critical issue, in particular if light 
plastic materials are used in order to reduce the overall weight of the system. For example, 
light, thin mobile phones with optical zoom optics are still rare, so there is much room for the 
further improvement of miniature zoom optics. 
Many researchers have considered the applications of liquid optics in miniature zoom 
optics [1–6]; not only can a liquid lens vary the curvature without a traditional mechanical 
cam, but it can also take advantage of synchronized focus and zoom works with much less 
power consumption than the traditional cam system of zoom optics needs [1–4]. One paper 
reported recently that a liquid lens was applied to an auto-focus operation [6]. However, there 
are difficulties in the optical design of miniature zoom optics with liquid optics as zoom 
variators, which means that liquid optics may take over most variations of the optical power 
of miniature zoom optics in order to eliminate the compensation work of other optical 
elements; and this may significantly simplify the opto-mechanical system of optics. First, the 
negative power of zoom optics is so limited that field curvature will become inherent, which 
seriously degrades the system modulation transfer function (MTF). Second, the abbe numbers 
of materials of liquid optics are not similar to those of extra dispersion optical materials and 
consequently, for most designs, axial chromatic aberration will become severe. Third, in 
optical designing, the chief rays may be vastly bent to fit the limited bore of liquid optics; but 
this may complicate the optical design, due to aberrations. Therefore, this research proposes a 
special optical layout, in order to address the ensuing problems, here presented in sections 2 
and 3. 
The optimization for miniature zoom optics with a liquid lens element is another critical 
issue in this research, because of difficulties in the traditional optimization method for these 
cases, damped least square (DLS). First, liquid optics make extended optimization for zoom 
optics difficult because of its inherent chromatic aberration and field curvature, due to weak 
negative power and the non-extra chromatic dispersion liquid employed in liquid optics. The 
genetic algorithm (GA) program [6–8] is employed first in the present paper, with DLS, not 
only to eliminate the chromatic aberrations during optimization but also to find the best 
solution during extended optimization. Second, traditional zoom lenses are designed and 
optimized according to the movement of a mechanical cam. However, the aspheric surface 
coefficients of both surfaces of liquid optics, which may be inherent in liquid optics, vary non-
linearly with the optical power of liquid optics and hence complicate attempts to optimize 
them with DLS. In order to improve performance, this research proposes a specially modified 
GA, which applies a matured digital signal processing (DSP) technology implement, based on 
motor control [9,10], which may work efficiently with an image processing engine [11–13]. 
This new concept with a modified GA program successfully optimizes zoom optics by 
exploiting liquid optics, as sections 3 and 4 demonstrate. 
2. Layout and methodology of optical zoom design 
There are difficulties in the optical design and optimization of zoom optics with a liquid optics 
element, mainly because the chief rays may be vastly bent to fit the limited bore of liquid 
optics and this may complicate the optical design. The optical design proposed in this paper 
employs four lens groups to lay out the 2X zoom with liquid optics, of which the overall 
length must be under 20mm. In addition, liquid optics will mostly control the optical power of 
the zoom in such a way as to replace traditional zoom cams. 
The liquid lenses named ARCTIC 416 of the simulation are produced by Varioptic SA [4]. 
Figure 1 shows a chart of the prototype. The specifications of liquid optics ARCTIC 416 are 
shown in Tables 1 and 2. The optical design layout in this research for a 2X optical zoom 
module with liquid lens elements is shown in Table 3, inclusive of the specifications of lens 
optics. Figures 2 and 3 show the two dimensional (2D) plots and modulation transform 
function (MTF) diagram in each zoom, optimized by Code V software. Finally, Table 4 lists 
the lens prescription.

group, composed of both liquid optics, to take over most zoom jobs. To attain this goal, a 
strong negative lens must be added after the liquid optics module (that is, S6, S9, S10 and 
S13) in order to achieve sufficient optical power variation between the two sets of liquid 
optics to produce the best zoom effect. In the optical design, the work of zoom variation 
during the optimization of the two liquid optics employed in this lens is restricted by 
constraints in the settings. It is estimated that, in this research, the liquid optics contribute up 
to 80% of the zoom variation. The last group is used as a compensator handled by a precise 
step motor. 
With regard to the inherent problem of liquid optics, it is understood that the aspheric 
surface coefficients of both surfaces of liquid optics vary non-linearly with the optical power 
of liquid optics, thus complicating the optimization with DLS. In this research, a new method 
is proposed, that of digitalizing each zoom of the 2X zoom optics, which indicate that it works 
only if defined as an “effective zoom ratio” of zoom optics such as 1.0X, 1.05X, 1.1X, etc. 
This allows the aspheric coefficient of the liquid optics to be measured, because its optical 
power is precisely defined. Then the traditional DLS method will work well for optimizing the 
zoom optics with a digitalized zoom ratio with aspheric coefficients. However, there will be 
no function of the zoom optics between the digitalized zoom ratios. 
In this optical design, a digitalized zoom ratio is defined as gradually increasing by 
0.125X on each step up to 2X. In total, nine degrees of zoom are optimized by CODE V from 
the initial layout.

3. Modified genetic algorithm (GA) optimization applied to zoom lens with liquid optics 
for extended optimization 
The initial optimization of zoom optics with liquid optics by CODE V may works but its 
performance is very limited. This may be because there are too many constraints and rich 
chromatic aberrations during the optimization. As extended optimization proceeds, CODE V 
with macro language via GA will be employed in this research in order to reach best 
performance. GA will play a significant role in the elimination of chromatic aberration, field 
curvature and the improvement of MTF during the extended optimization if the optical layout 
is correct. 
The GA process starts by randomly creating an initial population and then allowing 
reproduction, crossover and mutation to proceed, according to the Fitness Function [6–
8,14,15], as displayed in Fig. 4.

where β is a random number from 0 to 1, and ui and li are the upper and lower boundaries of 
xi. 
A GA program is employed in this research not only to eliminate chromatic aberrations 
and field curves during optimization but also to find the best solution for a discrete zoom set 
to minimize the aberration. The wavelength setting of the ray is determined according to the 
visible light, as shown in Table 5. Table 6 gives the weight setting of Fit(n) (Eq. (1) above the 
paragraph), and Table 7 gives the parameter setting, Fig. 6 gives the gene mapping in the GA 
program. The multi-point crossover method is used for each gene in the crossover operation. 
The multi-point mutation method (Eg.3) is used for each curvature and thickness gene and the 
glass gene is chosen randomly from the glass database in the mutation operation.

5. Conclusions and outlook 
According to the results of the simulation, it is concluded that this proposed optical design and 
the modified GA program employed was finally successful and completely met the 
specification required with the assistance of the aspheric surfaces. By extended optimization 
with CODE V and the employment of a modified GA program, it is shown in the results that 
AX of the zoom optics with liquid lens has been improved by 39.68%, compared to the initial 
system and that the LAT is 77.02%, sagittal field curves are 84.97%, tangential field curves 
are 75.92% and finally the spot size is minimized up to 48.86% under at least 85% relative 
illumination, while the MTF almost reaches the optical diffraction limit except at the extreme 
edge of the image circle, unlike the traditional DLS method. 
The aspheric surface of liquid optics, if it could be precisely measured by an advanced 
interferometer, significantly improves the final performance of this zoom optics.

Abstract—This paper focuses on the improvement of the Petzval 
field curvature aberration that is induced by the lens curvature 
and refractive index. Most primary aberrations can be effectively 
corrected by using aspherical lens while the Petzval filed 
curvature regarded as intrinsic to an optical system cannot easy 
be corrected through the high order coefficient of aspherical lens. 
With the global optimization of the genetic algorithm (GA), this 
study applies the basic selection, crossover and mutation 
operator to optimize a group of lens curvatures and thicknesses 
so that not only the Petzval field curvature aberration is 
effectively improved but also the specification requirement is met 
in a projector system.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
The project optic technology is attracted to many 
applications once again in a few years, especially in the 3D 
market. The projector system plays the role at home theater 
movie through its large projection screen from point view of 
high definition television (HDTV) [1-2] and also projectors 
take advantage of easily delivery compared to huge 65 inch 
liquid crystal display. Thanks to demand of high quality of 
HDTV, many solutions are proposed to enhance the 
resolutions and contrast [1-3]. However, field curvature is still 
a critical issue so far.  
According to different kinds of aberration from Seidel 
Aberrations Polynomial, we can find the primary field 
curvature aberration (primary FCA) is respected both 
astigmatism factor and Petzval factor [4]. The most popular 
technology, aspherical surface, is able to minimize 
astigmatism factor plus Petzval factor so that primary FCA 
might reach minimum. However, the well-corrected primary 
astigmatism in optimization software might get worse due to 
tolerance issues especially around the edge of image height, 
which might be visible if image height is quite large.   
In this paper, we propose a method to minimize FCA 
together with Least Square Damped (LSD) during 
optimization and extended optimization, which might 
minimize Petzval FCA plus astigmatism together. This 
proposed method indicates that total primary FCA will be 
minimized with minimized Petzval FCA. Some literatures 
suggested the optimization with variance of radius of 
curvature of image plane [5] to alleviate the Petzval FCA; 
however, it is unrealistic to vary the radius of curvature of the 
screen for the purpose of Petzval FCA elimination in the 
projector system especially in 3D market. With the concept 
that the primary FCA is composed of both the astigmatism 
factor and the Petzval factor, we will focus on eliminating the 
Petzval FCA in the telecentric projector system during 
optimization and extended optimization in this research. Since 
great commercial software CODE V employs LSD method [6-
7] go through optimizations, we proposed a better solution 
which implements the global searching capability of GA [8-12] 
to accomplish both optimization and efficiency as well. The 
organization of this paper is as follow. In section II the 
planning of preliminary telecentric projector optics is 
described. Section III represents the process of GA and its role 
of optimization in lens design. Finally we demonstrate the 
simulation results and make discussions in section IV. The 
conclusion will be shown in section V.  
 
Fig.1 The structure of preliminary design of projector lens.  
II. PRELIMINARY PROJECTOR LENS  
The design of this optical system are demonstrated: there 
are four lens groups for focusing and four lens groups for 
compensation. Since regular projector lenses tend to have 
more serious lateral chromatic aberration due to image height, 
some particular extra-dispersion glass materials might be 
usually employed to improve the lateral chromatic aberration. 
These glass materials could destroy the normal propagation of 
where β is a random number in between zero and one. In 
addition, to make optimized solution possible, we have to 
introduce the mutation operation. Just like in the real world 
every single gene is possible to mutate, a randomly generate 
number α  in between zero and one is generated for each gene 
parameter. When α  is smaller than the mutation rate pm, 
(α < pm), the mutation operation is implemented for gene 
parameters. The equation of gene mutation computation is   
zi’ = zi ± β∆   (6) 
where ∆ is a limiting range and its purpose is to avoid 
divergence caused by undesirable mutation; the β is also a 
random number between zero and one. Those three operations 
mentioned above, namely the selection, the crossover and the 
mutation are the basic functions in the GA.  
In the GA simulation, either increase population size or 
mutation rate can achieve optimization and generate best 
genes. In our paper the population size is set to 1000 to run 
optimization. The different gene parameters and the 
combinations of lens sets are generated randomly at the 
beginning. However there is a great chance that it is 
impossible to reach the specified obj_Value from randomly 
generated lens combinations at the first run of GA 
computation. In this case the crossover operation is performed 
on the first generation to produce the offspring; the roulette 
rules mentioned above is then used to select two lenses sets for 
crossover operation. Through above processes and the 
mutation operation, the GA provides better genes to the 
systems for simulations. The mutation rate is usually set to 
less than 0.2 for a large population and otherwise for smaller 
population. After the basic GA operations, the offspring will 
propagate following this model. Let the crossover rate be 0.8 
to generate offspring, in other words for 1000 parents, there 
will be 800 offspring. The best 20% of parent population will 
be passed on to offspring since stronger individual can live 
longer and has better chance to extend to next generation. The 
population of each generation is kept as 1000 for each 
generation thereafter, and the GA computation iterates until 
we find the optimized set that satisfies the specification or 
reach the preset generation number at the beginning of 
iteration. In either case the result of the last run of the GA 
program should be the optimized parameters set. Figure 2 
presents the flow chart of GA.  
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
The specification of this system are following: three zooms, 
namely zoom1, zoom5 and zoom9. The objective values of 
effective focal length correspond to EFLS1 = 23, EFLS2 = 25 
and EFLS3 = 27 in equation (1), respectively. The lens 
designed from CODE V commercial software for our 
optimization purpose at beginning has Petzval FCA values (-
0.068864, -0.068864, -0.068864). The corresponding effective 
focal length is (23.0000, 25.0845, 27.2197). In order to make 
GA more flexible when performing optimization procedures, 
we change the objective function, equation (1), to the 
following so that it can tolerate the effective focal length 
within a certain range.

The value of weights w1 and w2 in equation (7) are both set

the required obj_Value, namely equals to or very close to zero. 
Here, 15 runs of simulations are performed. Among the 15 
simulation runs, the best run has Petzval FCA value (0.000001, 
0.000001, 0.000001), and its corresponding effective focal 
length is (22.9523, 24.8010, 26.8176). The worst run has

the average value of gene parameters in 15 simulation runs. 
Let the average value of gene parameters be the lens 
parameters, then the Petzval FCA value obtained is (0.000000, 
0.000000, 0.000000), and its corresponding effective focal 
length is (23.0344, 25.0675, 27.1771). In order to evaluate the 
permissible tolerance of each gene parameters to this average 
value, we calculate the standard deviation and include the 
calculated values in “STDev” field of Table 1 and Table 2. 
The “|STDev/Average| % ” field of Table 1 and Table 2 are 
obtained from dividing the standard deviation by this average

                                for i =1, 2, …, pop_size               (1) 
where z represents the number of the zoom, that is, z =1, 2, 3; 
the SIV is the Seidel aberrations term for Petzval FCA; the EFLS 
is the required effective focal length and EFLGA is the effective 
focal length computed from the GA. The SPO is the root mean 
square (rms) spot diameter. The value of weights w1 , w2 and w3 
in Equation (1) are set to 200, 10, and 400, respectively. From 
Equation (1), we can evaluate how closely each lens system fits 
the specifications (targets). The target value is also known as 
obj_Value (i) and will be used as a reference for the crossover 
operation in the GA. Noting that in Equation (1) the value of 
the objective functions is expressed as the smaller or the closer 
to zero, the better. Therefore we need to transform the target 
values to their corresponding adaptability value, according to 
the following equation, also called the fit function:   
fit_Value(i) = max{obj_Value (i)} + min{ obj_Value (i)} - 
obj_Value (i)  for i = 1, 2, …, pop_size                      (2)  
From Equation (2) the probability that each lens will be 
selected for the crossover operation is  
p(i) = fit_Value(i)/∑
=
sizepop
n nValuefit_1 )(_   for i = 1, 2, …, 
pop_size  (3)  
According to the roulette rule, the area (probability) of the 
whole dish is 1 and the area (probability) occupied by each lens 
system is calculated from Equation (3). The cumulative 
probability of each lens system in terms of the roulette dish 
area is obtained from the following:  
q(i) = ∑∑
==
sizepop
m
i
n mpnp
_
11 )(/)(  for i =1, 2, ..., pop_size         
(4-a) 
and  
q(0) = 0   (4-b)  
We first randomly generate a number α  between zero and 
one; if q(i-1) < α ≦q(i), we then select the gene parameters 
from the ith lens system. Since each crossover operation needs 
two sets of lens system parameters, the roulette rule is 
implemented twice to get two different sets of parameters. Next, 
the crossover operation is executed. Let X = (x1, x2, …, xN)  and 
Y = (y1, y2, …, yN) represent the two different sets of selected 
lens system parameters. Then the gene set of the offspring Z = 
(z1, z2, …, zN) can be obtained from  
zi = βxi+(1 - β)yi      (5)  
where β is a random number between zero and one. In addition, 
to make an optimized solution possible, we have to introduce 
the mutation operation. Just as in the natural world, where 
every single gene can mutate, a randomly generated number 
α between zero and one is generated for each gene parameter. 
When α  is smaller than the mutation rate pm, (α < pm), the 
mutation operation is implemented for gene parameters. The 
equation for gene mutation computation is   
zi’ = zi ± β∆   (6) 
where ∆ is a limiting range and its purpose is to avoid any 
divergence caused by undesirable mutation; β is also a random 
number between zero and one. The three operations mentioned 
above, namely, selection, crossover and mutation, are the basic 
functions in the GA. Figure 2 presents the flow chart of GA.

The specifications of this system are as follows: three 
zooms, namely, zoom1, zoom5 and zoom9. The objective 
values of effective focal length correspond to EFLS1 = 23, 
EFLS2 = 25 and EFLS3 = 27 respectively, in Equation (1). The 
lens designed by commercial software for our optimization 
purpose at the beginning has Petzval FCA values (-0.068864, -
0.068864, -0.068864). The corresponding effective focal length 
is (23.0000, 25.0845, 27.2197). Then the GA is performed to 
simulate and optimize for the required obj_Value, namely, 
equaling or very close to zero. Here, 10 runs of simulations are 
performed. Among the 10 simulation runs, the best run has 
Petzval FCA values of 0.000698, 0.000698 and 0.000698 and 
its corresponding effective focal lengths are 23.2310, 25.2255 
and 26.8870. The worst run has Petzval FCA values of 
0.013945, 0.013945 and 0.013945 and its corresponding 
effective focal lengths are 23.0974, 25.0373 and 26.8413. Their 
corresponding gene parameters are shown in Tables I and II. In 
Table I, the gene parameters 1 to 27 correspond to the lens 
curvature of surfaces 1 to 15 and surfaces 17 to 28. In Table II 
the gene parameters 28 to 55 correspond to the lens thickness 
of surfaces 1 to 15 and the gene parameters 56 to 64 
correspond to the three zooms lens thickness of surfaces 8, 9, 
11, and 23.
