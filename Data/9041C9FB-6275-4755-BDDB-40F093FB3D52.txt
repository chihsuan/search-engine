environments have been reported to occur not only at scales of meters (Adrian et al., 2004), but 
also at scales of centimeters (Beloin et al., 1998; Murray et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2001).  In a 
study on the anaerobic biodegradation of hydrocarbons in a contaminated aquifer, a 
heterogeneous decay model predicted the decrease in toluene concentration with distance.  The 
model suggested that spatially heterogeneous decay rates operate in the aquifer (Hunt et al., 
1998).  The objective of this research was to study the distribution of microbial and geochemical 
parameters in contaminated and pristine regions of two gasoline-contaminated aquifers  
undergoing intrinsic bioremediation, with the expectation that such data will provide insight into 
factors controlling biodegradation in each aquifer. 
 
Experimental Design 
Microbial populations and site geochemistry were characterized in a series of three experiments.  
In the first experiment, variability in microbial populations was evaluated in both contaminated 
and pristine sediment samples spaced 2-3 cm apart vertically.  Six contaminated and three 
pristine samples were analyzed as located in Figure 1a.  Sediment samples from the 
contaminated region were collected between 2.13 to 2.74 m and 2.74 to 3.35 m, while samples 
from the pristine region were collected between 2.74 and 3.35 m.  In the second experiment, 
variability in microbial populations and geochemical parameters was evaluated in six 
contaminated sediment samples collected at 0.3 m vertical intervals.  Samples were obtained 
from 2.90 to 5.03 m.  In the third experiment, horizontal variability was evaluated in samples 
collected 55, 90 and 175 m from the source area at a depth of 3.35 to 3.96 m. 
Two experiments were conducted to characterize microbial populations and site 
geochemistry.  Sediment sample points are located in Figure 1b.  In the first experiment, 
variability in microbial populations was evaluated in contaminated sediment collected at 7.5 cm

collected in plastic sleeves as described above except that in experiment 1 a 12.7 cm diameter x 
1.5 m long plastic sleeve was used.  Inocula for microbial enumerations were formed within 24 
hours of arrival in the laboratory. 
 
Groundwater Collection  
Groundwater was collected anaerobically from the same location where the sediment was 
collected except for locations where vertical heterogeneity was studied in which case samples 
were obtained from nearby (~ 0.6 m) multilevel samplers with ports at 0.3 m intervals.  Before 
and during sample collection, the well headspace was sparged with argon.  Groundwater was 
pumped from the well, through a closed system of polyethylene tubing equipped with a 0.45 μm 
filter (Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI), and collected in a nitrogen-sparged 2.3 L bottle.  The 
water was transported to the laboratory on ice where it was stored at 4 oC prior to analysis. 
 
Microbial Population Enumeration 
Acridine orange direct counts (AODC) were conducted as described by Wilson et al., (1983).  
Inocula for enumeration of total heterotrophs, Fe reducers, sulfate reducers, methanogens and 
aerobic and anaerobic protozoa were formed by addition of 10 g of sediment to 90 mL of the 
groundwater corresponding to each sediment sample.  Dilution series were then prepared in 
groundwater. 
Total heterotrophs were enumerated by 5 tube most probable number (MPN) tests.  The medium 
consisted of the following (grams per liter): glucose (10), yeast extract (1), trypticase peptones 
(2), KH2PO4 (1.61), Na2HPO4 . 7H2O (3.18), NH4Cl (1), NaCl (0.9), MgCl2 . 6H2O (0.2), CaCl2 . 
2H2O (0.1), NaHCO3 (3.5), cysteine hydrochloride (0.5).  In addition the medium contained 10 
mL/L of a trace mineral solution (Kenealy and Zeikus, 1981) with the addition of Na2WO4 
  
8
on the addition of an inoculum to a glass ring immobilized with agar in a petri dish.  
Enterobacter aerogenes is grown separately on trypticase soy agar and added to each cylinder as 
a food source for protozoa.  One mL of the inoculum was added to each of five replicate rings at 
each dilution.  For anaerobic protozoa, petri dishes were incubated in the anaerobic chamber at 
25 oC.  In most cases, up to 10 days of incubation were necessary before protozoa could be 
observed and liquid samples in glass rings were checked for two months before they were 
considered negative.  For aerobic tests, samples were counted as negative if no protozoa were 
observed after 1 month.  Encysted protozoa were enumerated by treating a separate subsample of 
the initial sediment extract with 10 mL of 0.55N HCl for 15 minutes to kill vegetative protozoa.  
A greater MPN in the untreated sample relative to the treated sample indicated the presence of 
vegetative protozoa. 
All samples were incubated at 25 oC and MPNs were calculated using a computer 
program (Russek and Colwell, 1983).   The petri dishes containing the protozoan MPN tests 
were incubated in anaerobic  hood (Coy Laboratory Products, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI). 
 
Analytical Methods 
Aqueous Phase 
BTEX, mesitylene and pseudocumene were analyzed by EPA Method 602, using a Tekmar 
Purge-and-Trap Model LSC 2000 with a Perkin-Elmer Model 9000 Auto System Gas 
Chromatograph (GC).  Dissolved methane was analyzed by GC as described in Hunt et al., 
(1997).  Sulfate was analyzed using a Dionex 2010i ion chromatograph with a Dionex AS4A 
column and 1.8 mM of sodium carbonate and 1.7 mM of sodium bicarbonate as mobile phase.  
Fe(II)aq was analyzed either colorometrically as described above or using a Perkin Elmer II 
inductively coupled plasma argon emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). 
  
10
population (AODC) was on the order of 106 cells per gm, which is consistent with previous 
reports.  The protozoan population in non-acid treated samples exceeded that in the acid-treated 
samples, indicating that the protozoan population was dominated by vegetative cells as opposed 
to cysts.  Geochemical analyses were not performed on these samples due to limited sample size. 
In general, populations in the contaminated region (samples A-F) were higher than 
populations in the pristine region (samples a-c), which is consistent with microbial growth in 
response to increased carbon.  t-Tests were conducted on the log-transformed population data as 
this transformation has been shown to reduce skewness (Zhang et al., 1997).  Fe-reducers in both 
contaminated sets (A-C, D-F) were greater (p=0.05) than in the pristine sediment population (a-
c).  Similarly, there was a significant difference in AODC between D-F and a-c, but not between 
A-C and a-c.  Amongst aerobic protozoa, both sets A-C and D-F were significantly greater than 
a-c, while anaerobic protozoa were only greater in A-C relative to a-c.  Both aerobic and 
anaerobic protozoa decreased with depth that is consistent with previous reports (Sandon, 1927; 
Sinclair and Ghiorse, 1987). 
Coefficients of variation (CVs) for the log-transformed data were 1.1, 0.4, and 4.3% for the 
AODCs in sets A-C, D-F and a-c, respectively.  The corresponding CVs for the Fe-reducer 
populations were 17.7, 3.6 and 3.8%.  Thus, there was relatively little variation in the 
populations of closely spaced samples.  CVs for the protozoan data were much higher which is 
attributed to their low populations.  
 
Variability in 0.3 m Vertical Intervals 
Variations in microbial populations at 0.3 m intervals are presented in Figure 3.  The AODC was 
always on the order of 106 cells/dry gm and vegetative cells always exceeded the number of 
encysted protozoa.  In contrast to the closely spaced samples (Figure 2), there was substantial 
  
12
elevated sulfate.  It is possible that the elevated sulfate is leading to increased sulfate reduction 
and precipitation of FeS.  Alternately, there is less biological activity in this layer. 
Hydrocarbon concentrations varied considerably with depth (Figure 4).  Lower 
concentrations were measured at 3.05 m while higher concentrations were observed at 4.88 m.  
These data could be explained by a sinking plume.  However, at 4.3 m, m- and p-xylene are 
depleted relative to benzene and pseudocumene is depleted relative to mesitylene.  Such trends 
suggest varying biodegradation rates with depth. 
Differences in the trends between aqueous Fe(II) and 0.5 N extractable Fe(II) (Table 1) 
illustrates the limitations of aqueous phase analyses.  While Fe(II)aq was present at all depths, 
and it was fairly constant between 3.35 and 4.27 m, there were large variations in solid phase 
Fe(II) over this interval.  Assuming a sediment bulk density of 1.7 kg/L and a porosity of 0.4, 
between 31 and 98% of the aqueous plus 0.5N HCl extractable Fe(II) was on the solid phase.  
This range suggests that variations in geochemical conditions govern Fe(II) dissolution and 
precipitation.  In ongoing research, Fe(II) precipitation has been shown to limit Fe(III) 
bioavailability (manuscript submitted).  The sediment extracts also show substantial variability 
in the sedimentary Fe(III) that may ultimately be available for microbial reduction.  As expected, 
substantially more Fe was extracted with 5 N HCl relative to 0.5 N HCl.  The sediment was 
dominated by sand and there was little variability between layers.  Also, there was no correlation 
between the clay fraction and the presence of Fe(III) (r2  = 0.54 and 0.00 for 0.5 N and 5 N HCl 
extractable Fe(III)).   
The variability in the Fe-reducing, anaerobic protozoan and hydrocarbon concentration 
data are all consistent with variations in biological activity with depth.  The low Fe-reducer 
population at 4.88 m is consistent with the elevated hydrocarbon concentrations, and the low 
sedimentary Fe(III) based on a 0.5 N HCl extraction.  While Fe(III) was more abundant based on 
  
14
(Table 4).  Hydrocarbon concentrations are elevated at the downgradient (X3) location and there 
is no apparent preferential depletion of any hydrocarbon. 
As in experiment II (Table 1) there was not a good correlation between aqueous and 0.5 
N HCl extractable Fe(II).  While there was little variability in Fe(II)aq, it was barely detectable in 
the solid phase at X2.  The fraction of the total Fe(II) associated with the solid phase based on 
0.5 N HCl extractions was 95, 51, 94 % for X1, X2 and X3, respectively.  As expected greater 
amounts of Fe was extracted using 5 N HCl.  Although there are only 3 data points, there is a 
correlation between the clay content and Fe(III) extracted using 5 N HCl (r2 = 0.99) and 0.5 N 
HCl (r2 = 0.83).  Interestingly, while the Fe extractions (0.5 and 5 N HCl) for X1 and X3 
locations are within 20%, the Fe-reducer population at X3 is over 100 times greater.  This could 
be attributed to different mineral forms or the increased carbon present at X3.  
 
Summary of Site A 
Microbial and geochemical characterization reveals that there exists substantial spatial 
heterogeneity at SITE A.  There was less variation among closely spaced vertical samples (2-3 
cm apart) than in samples at 0.3 m vertical intervals or samples at varying distances from the 
contaminant source.  Similar observations were reported in microbiological and chemical 
properties in a contaminated aquifer at Oyester, Virginia (Zhang et al., 1997).  The low 
variability in AODCs in Experiments 1 and 2 is consistent with previous reports (Alberchtsen et 
al., 1995). 
Among the populations enumerated, iron reducers were dominant relative to sulfate-
reducers and methanogens.  They were present at all locations and their dominance is supported 
by the presence of Fe(II) (solid and aqueous).  Variability in iron reducers was observed in both 
the vertical (experiment II) and horizontal (experiment III) scales.  There was greater variability 
  
16
Variability in 7.5 cm Vertical Intervals 
Based on the distribution of microbial populations in closely spaced samples (2-3 cm) and 0.3-m 
intervals at Site A, vertical variations in microbial populations at Site B were studied at 7.5 cm 
intervals.   
As illustrated in Figure 7, total heterotrophs, Fe-reducers, SO4-reducers and methanogens 
were detected in most samples.  There was substantial variability in the distribution of microbial 
populations.  Total heterotrophs varied between 46 and 1080 cells/dry g except at 3.74 m where 
greater than 107 cells/ dry g were detected.  The Fe-reducing population exhibited variation of 
two orders of magnitude and was highest at depths greater than 3.44 m.  The sulfate-reducing 
population was always less than 80 cells/dry gm and was concentrated between 3.07 and 3.44 m.  
Methanogen populations were even lower than the sulfate-reducers and there was no apparent 
pattern.  Methanogens were not detectable at the depths of the highest Fe-reducing population.  
Aerobic protozoa were detected in only the 2.92 and 2.99 m intervals (21 and 4 cells/g) and 
anaerobic protozoa were never detected.   
Vertical variations in Fe(II)aq, SO4 and CH4 are presented in Table 5 and concentrations 
were relatively consistent over the depth sampled.  Biodegradation capacities calculated for 
various electron acceptors suggest iron reduction, sulfate reduction and methanogenesis are all 
occurring upgradient of the sampled locations (Table 6).  Hydrocarbon concentrations did not 
exhibit much variation over the depth tested and no preferential depletion was measured (Figure 
8).  There is no apparent explanation for the elevated m,p-xylene concentration at 3.6 m.   
Substantially more Fe was extracted with 5 N HCl relative to 0.5 N (Table 7).  There was 
little variability in Fe(II) extracted using 5 N (avg. = 0.15 and CV = 21%) and the increased 
variability with the 0.5 N HCl (avg. = 0.01 and CV = 54%) is likely due to the very small 
amount of extractable Fe(II).  The fraction of total Fe(II) associated with the solid phase was 69, 
  
18
and sulfate-reducers and methanogens in the pristine region further suggests the relationship 
between the added carbon and microbial population development. 
A geochemical characterization of groundwater and sediment at varying distances from 
the contaminant source is presented in Table 8 and Figure 10. Aqueous measurements of Fe(II)aq, 
sulfate and methane varied  along the plume. Biodegradation capacities presented in Table 9 
suggest that iron reduction, sulfate reduction and methanogenesis are dominant upgradient of 
Y1, while methanogenesis is dominant upgradient of Y2 and all three microbial processes appear 
to be active upgradient of Y3. There was considerable variability in the concentrations of 
dissolved hydrocarbons (Figure 10). The general decrease in their concentration with distance 
from the source is consistent with the attenuation via both biodegradation and dilution. Low 
hydrocarbon concentrations at Y3 are attributed to the free product recovery system installed 
upgradient of Y3. There appears to be no preferential depletion of selected hydrocarbons. 
Between Y1 and Y2, all hydrocarbons were depleted by 30% except benzene that appears to be 
steady.  This would suggest that biodegradation, rather than dilution, is responsible for the 
measured decrease in concentrations. 
As expected, more Fe was extracted with 5 N HCl relative to 0.5 N HCl.  The amount of 
Fe(II) and Fe(III) extracted using 0.5 N HCl was small and showed little variability.  The 
fraction of the total Fe(II) produced that was on the solid phase was 60 – 72%.  The low recovery 
of Fe(III) with 0.5N HCl indicates that there is very little poorly crystalline iron oxide (Heron et 
al., 1994).  In contrast 5 N HCl extractions showed a substantial increase in sedimentary Fe(III) 
which ultimately may be available for microbial reduction.  The sediment was dominated by 
sand and the correlation between clay fraction and presence of Fe(III) was poor (r2 = 0.63 and 
0.17 for 0.5 and 5 N HCl extractions respectively). 
  
20
Sediment texture did not appear to influence microbial or geochemical parameters 
(experiment I and II).  Solid phase Fe analysis suggests geochemical conditions in this aquifer 
may be different since the percentage of Fe(II) in aqueous phase is relatively higher compared to 
other aquifers (Heron and Christensen 1995; Lovely et., 1988. 
 
Discussion 
For determining biodegradation rates microcosms are constructed with homogenized sediment 
retrieved at varying depth in the contaminated aquifer.  Studies of soil environments have 
demonstrated that tens of Kg of soil were necessary to obtain a representative soil mass for 
estimating natural denitrification rates (Parkin et al., 1987).  However large variations in 
microbiological and chemical properties at closely spaced intervals have been reported for 
subsurface sediments and groundwater systems (Beloin et al., 1988; Ronen et al., 1987; Smith et 
al, 1991).  In sediment samples which were 10 cm apart variability in microbial abundance and 
activity varied by a factor of 3 to > 220 (Beloin et., 1988).  However less variability in microbial 
populations were reported in marine sediment study (Litchfield et al., 1979).  In a recent study 
on the spatial variations of microbial properties in subsurface sediments, Zhang et al., found that 
sample size (0.1 to 100 g) and close interval (~ 5 cm) sampling did not appear to affect the 
variability.  In this study microbial populations also showed little variability in samples spaced at 
2-3 cm apart (SITE A). 
However, at 0.3 m intervals (SITE A) there appeared to be variability in microbial and 
geochemical parameters.  Iron reducers, which were the predominant microbial populations, 
varied 4 orders of magnitude on the vertical scale.  Similar variability in iron reducers (102 - 104 
cells per gram sediment) were reported in vertical profiles (20 - 70 cm intervals) in an aquifer 
contaminated with crude oil (Beckins et al., 1988).  At PAB, shifts in the dominance of trophic

8 and 9).  One interesting observation among iron reducers and methanogens was that 
methanogens were not detected where iron reducers were maximum on vertical scale (Figure 7) 
and where methanogenesis was dominant microbial processes on the horizontal scale iron 
reducers were lower compared to other locations on the horizontal scale (Figure 9 and Table 8).  
Similar observations have been reported at a crude oil contaminated aquifer undergoing intrinsic 
bioremediation (Beckins et al., 1998). 
Aerobic and anaerobic protozoa were detected predominantly at SITE A.  At PAB expect 
for two shallow layers where aerobic protozoa were detected the remaining layers did not harbor 
any aerobic or anaerobic protozoa.  Absence of protozoa in given subsurface substratum may be 
related to a finer texture (Sinclair and Ghiorse, 1987).  At PAB the clay content was higher than 
SITE A (Tables 1 and &) and the sediment was more cohesive which could be why protozoa 
were not detected in deeper zones.  Also, environmental factors such as organic and inorganic 
concentrations may influence the distribution of protozoa in subsurface (Sinclair and Ghiorse, 
1987).  However, elevated numbers of protozoa at SITE A suggests bacterial predation that may 
be controlling biodegradation rates (Sinclair et al., 1993, Kinner et al., 1992).   
Variations in hydrocarbon measurements and the preferential depletion of selected 
hydrocarbons were more prevalent at SITE A relative to PAB in thin layers.  At SITE A 
variations in hydrocarbon concentrations and microbial populations were relatively consistent.  
At PAB there was less variability in hydrocarbon concentrations on vertical scale but shifts in 
the dominance of trophic groups were observed in thin layers that may indicate variability in 
biodegradation potential among layers.  Therefore, if most biological activity is occurring in 
relatively thin layers of the aquifer, then the vertically averaged contaminant concentrations 
obtained from traditional monitoring wells with 1.67-m screens will be misleading, as only 
contaminants exposed to specific layers of the sediment will biodegrade.

practice of evaluating the importance of Fe(III) to the biodegradation capacity of the aquifer 
undergoing intrinsic bioremediation has to be reevaluated.

crystalline oxides by oxalate, resulting in an overestimation of the amount of bioavailable Fe(III) 
(Heron et al, 1994; Phillips et al. 1993).  Since aquifer sediments often contain Fe(II) 
compounds, ammonium oxalate cannot be used for the determination of poorly crystalline Fe(III) 
in such systems (Heron et al. 1994).  Other workers have estimated bioavailable Fe(III) based on 
the accumulation of dissolved Fe(II).  However, this approach may seriously underestimate 
Fe(III) availability since much of the Fe(II) produced remains in solid forms (Lovley, 1987 & 
1995).  
 Iron bioavailability could also be limited by coating the mineral surfaces with sorbed or 
precipitated Fe(II).  Most Fe(II) produced in sediments is present in the solid phase adsorbed 
onto surfaces or in a variety of reduced minerals including magnetite (Fe3O4), siderite (FeCO3) 
and vivianite (Fe3PO4 • 8H2O) (Lovley, 1987, 1991 & 1995).  However the effect of sorption 
and/or precipitation of Fe(II) on Fe(III) bioavailability in sediments is not well understood.  In 
one study, washing an Fe(II) fouled iron oxide with NaAc to remove adsorbed and/or 
precipitated Fe(II) stimulated Fe(III) reduction (Roden and Zachara, 1996).  In a study using a 
dissimilatory Fe(III)-reducing bacterium, microbial Fe(III) oxide reduction was found to be 
controlled by sorption of Fe(II) to cell and oxide surfaces (Urrutia et al. 1998). 
 In this research, several factors potentially limiting Fe(III) bioavailability were evaluated 
using sediment from a petroleum-contaminated aquifer.  Specific objectives of this work were to: 
(a) determine the amount of Fe(III) in the sediment available for microbial reduction; (b) relate 
Fe(III) depletion to shifts in microbial processes; (c) evaluate the effect of Fe(II) sorption and/or 
precipitation on Fe(III) availability; and (d) identify extraction methods that correlate with the 
amount of Fe(III) that is actually reduced.  
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN 
Sediment and groundwater were obtained from a petroleum-contaminated aquifer at a location 
where Fe(III) was the predominant electron acceptor.  This sediment was characterized using 
several different extraction methods (0.5 N HCl extraction for 1 and 24 hr.; oxalate extraction for 
4 hr., 24 hr., and 7 days, and 5 N HCl extraction for 28 days).  Macrocosms containing this 
sediment were repeatedly fed benzaldehyde and monitored for depletion of Fe(III), production of 
solid and aqueous phase Fe(II), benzaldehyde degradation and accumulation of degradation 
intermediates.  Benzaldehyde was chosen as the carbon source since it is readily biodegradable 
and is presumed to be an intermediate in toluene biodegradation via iron reduction (Lovley and 
Lonergan, 1990).  Treatments consisted of three live added carbon, one live-control (no added 
carbon) and one abiotic (benzaldehyde added) macrocosm.   
 After approximately 400 hours of incubation, iron reduction slowed and fermentation 
products began to accumulate.  However, a significant amount of Fe(III) still remained in the 
sediment.  Three potential hypotheses were developed to explain the apparent shift from Fe(III) 
reduction to fermentation: (1) Fe(III) availability was not limiting Fe(III) reduction and some 
other unknown factor was causing this shift; (2) the mineral surfaces were being fouled by 
sorption and/or precipitation of Fe(II), reducing the bioavailability of the remaining Fe(III); and 
(3) the mineral form of the remaining Fe(III) made it relatively unavailable for use by the 
sediment associated microorganisms. 
 To evaluate hypotheses 1 and 3, several different Fe(III) forms (amorphous-
oxyhydroxide, goethite and hematite) were added to separate microcosm incubations containing 
the sediment from the initial macrocosms after 700 hours of incubation.  To evaluate hypothesis 
2, a portion of the sediment was washed with either CaCl2 or NaAc.  CaCl2 should remove ion-
exchanged Fe(II) and NaAc should remove both carbonate precipitated and ion-exchanged Fe(II) 
  
54
(Kostka et al. 1996) and both ion exchanged and carbonate precipitated Fe(II) were removed 
with 1 M NaAc (pH, 5.0) (Roden and Zachara, 1996).  A third treatment contained sediment 
washed with DI only as a live control.  Each treatment consisted of two live and one abiotic 
microcosm. 
  
IRON MINERAL FORMS  
Amorphous Fe(III) oxide was prepared by neutralizing a 0.4 M solution of FeCl3 • 6H2O with 
NaOH and washing with distilled water (Lovley and Phillips, 1986).  Goethite was prepared by 
neutralizing FeCl2 • 4H2O (9.9 g/L) with 1 M NaHCO3 (Schwertmann, 1991).  X-ray diffraction 
analysis of freeze dried samples confirmed the mineral identities.  Amorphous FeCO3 was 
prepared by titrating 1 M FeCl2 with 1 M Na2CO3 to pH 7.0 and washing with distilled water.  
The stoichiometry of the precipitate was confirmed to be FeCO3 by Fe(II) and inorganic carbon 
analysis.  Hematite was purchased from Fisher Scientific Co. and siderite was purchased from 
Ward’s Natural Science Establishment, Inc. (Rochester, NY).  Goethite and hematite were sieved 
to a particle size < 100 m and siderite was sieve　 d to < 250 m.　  
 
MICROBIAL ENUMERATIONS 
The number of total anaerobes, Fe reducers, and methanogens (H2-utilizers and acetate-utilizers) 
were determined by Most Probable Number (MPN) assays.  Inocula were formed by shaking 10 
g of sediment in 90 mL of groundwater and dilution series were formed in groundwater.  1 mL 
portions of each dilution were inoculated in 9 mL of media.  MPNs were calculated using a 
computer program (Russek and Colwell, 1983).   
 Total anaerobes were enumerated with a 5 tube MPN assay (Barlaz et al. 1989).  Volatile 
fatty acids and hemin were excluded from the medium and the pH was adjusted to 7.  Tubes 
were scored positive based on elevated optical density after 1 month.  Methanogens were 
enumerated by a 5 tube MPN (Barlaz et al. 1989).  Tubes were scored positive if the headspace 
methane concentration exceeded 0.5% after 2 months. 
 Fe reducers were enumerated by 10 tube MPN using a medium selective for Fe(III) 
reducers (Lovley and Phillips, 1986).  The tubes were incubated for 2 months after which Fe(II) 
was measured.  For the Fe (II) analysis, 0.5 mL of sample was digested in 5 mL of 0.75 N HCl 
(anaerobically).  5.5 mL of acetate buffer at pH 5 (Stookey, 1970) containing phenanthroline (1 
powder pillow / 25 mL) was then added to the digest and absorbance was read at 510 nm.  Tubes 
were scored as positive if the dissolved Fe(II) exceeded that in uninoculated controls (P = 0.01).  
All MPN tests were incubated at 25 oC. 
  
 
ANALYTICAL METHODS 
Sediment Fe(II) and Fe(III) concentrations were determined using a 28 day extraction 
with 5 N HCl based on preliminary work in which Fe(II) and Fe(III) stabilized after 28 days.  To 
quantify Fe(II) and Fe(III), 2g of sediment were digested in 50 mL of HCl (5 N, anaerobic) for 
28 days.  The acid was first deaerated by boiling under a stream of O2-free N2.  In preliminary 
work, we found that deaeration of the HCl was necessary to prevent oxidation of dissolved Fe(II) 
to Fe(III).  After 28 days, 0.5 mL of the extract was filtered to remove particles greater than 0.2 
m and added to acetate buffer at pH 5 (Stookey, 1970) containing phenanthroline.  As above, 　
the Fe(II) concentration was determined by reading absorbance at 510 nm and comparing to a 
standard curve.  Total iron was determined by adding 1 mL of the filtered extract to 10% 
hydroxylamine-hydrochloride solution that served as a reductant.  After 20 minutes, this sample

and muscovite flakes.  X-ray diffraction has shown that most of the crystalline iron in the 
sediment is present as a mixed Fe(II):Fe(III) clay mineral--glauconite, with smaller amounts of 
the Fe(II) rich clay-berthierine and possibly iron-rich illite (Becker, 1992). 
 
MACROCOSM EXPERIMENT 
Macrocosms were constructed using contaminated aquifer sediment and contaminated 
groundwater.  Ethanol and acetate were present in the sediment and groundwater used to 
construct the macrocosms and consequently were present in all macrocosms.  In the killed 
control, ethanol, acetate and benzaldehyde did not degrade and both Fe(II) and Fe(III) 
remained constant over 700 hours of incubation (data not shown).   
 In the benzaldehyde amended macrocosms, approximately 7 mM benzaldehyde was fed 
over a 700 hour period by repeatedly respiking whenever benzaldehyde was depleted (Fig. 1).  
The benzaldehyde uptake rate increased up until ~400 hours and then decreased.  Total Fe(II) 
increased and Fe(III) decreased until about 400 hours after which Fe(II) production was nearly 
zero and there was no detectable Fe(III) depletion (Fig. 2).  More Fe(II) was produced in the 
benzaldehyde amended macrocosms than in the no-added carbon controls, indicating that 
benzaldehyde addition stimulated Fe reduction (Fig. 2).  Total anaerobes increased by 4 orders of 
magnitude and Fe reducers increased by 3 orders of magnitude in the benzaldehyde amended 
macrocosms (Table 2).  The large increase in Fe reducers correlates with the large amount of 
Fe(II) produced.  No methane was produced in these macrocosms and the number of 
methanogens remained below detection. 
 Acetate increased from about 2 mM to a maximum of ~ 4 mM between 250 and 300 
hours and then remained constant or declined slightly (Fig. 1).  Ethanol was also present in the 
benzaldehyde amended macrocosms and decreased from approximately 2.7 mM to 0.2 mM by 
100 hours and then remained steady until 250-300 hours.  After 300 hours, the ethanol 
concentration began to increase (Fig. 1).  Ethanol production was stimulated by benzaldehyde as 
a similar increase was not measured in the no carbon-addition macrocosms (Fig. 3) 
 Benzaldehyde was transformed to benzoate and benzylalcohol (Fig. 1), which were not 
biodegraded further in the macrocosms.  Benzoate is a known intermediate in the anaerobic 
biodegradation of both naturally occurring and xenobiotic aromatic compounds (Young and 
Frazer, 1987) and has been shown to degrade under Fe(III) reducing conditions (Lovley et al. 
1989).  However, A. putrefaciens was unable to couple the oxidation of benzoate to Fe(III) 
reduction even though it was able to oxidize a multitude of other electron donors (Lovley et al. 
1989).  In a study examining the fate of hydrocarbon metabolites, benzoate did not degrade when 
Fe(III) and sulfate were added as electron acceptors, even though iron reduction and sulfate 
reduction were important processes in situ and occurred in the microcosms (Cozzarelli et al. 
1995).  However, benzoate did degrade when nitrate was supplied as an electron acceptor.  It 
was concluded that the biogeochemical fate of specific organic acids observed in groundwater 
varied with the structure of the acid and the availability of electron acceptors (Cozzarelli et al. 
1995).  Using sediments from the deep terrestrial subsurface (Jones et al. 1989), benzoate only 
degraded in those sediments that harbored methanogens and persisted in all non-methanogenic 
samples.  Benzoate and acetate disappearance always occurred concomitantly.  Therefore, the 
persistence of benzoate here can be attributed to the unavailability of a specific electron 
acceptor, non-methanogenic conditions or the absence of the required microorganisms.  
 Both benzoate and benzylalcohol were produced throughout the 700 hr incubation (Fig. 
1).  However, the ratio of benzylalcohol to benzoate varied considerably over time (Fig. 1).  
During the first 150 hours, when ethanol was being depleted, the benzylalcohol to benzoate ratio 
dropped steadily, indicating more oxidizing conditions.  During this same period, Fe(II) 
  
58
3).  Over this same period, total (solid + aqueous) Fe(II) increased from 10.7 mol/g to 13.3 　
mol/g sediment (Fig. 2).  During the first 100 hours, aqueous Fe(II) increased from 1.1 mM to 　
2 mM while solid Fe(II) remained fairly constant.  However from 100 to 400 hours, solid phase 
Fe(II) increased along with aqueous Fe(II).   
 We hypothesize that ethanol was fermented to acetate in these macrocosms by the 
following reaction. 
  CH3CH2OH (ethanol) + H2O Æ CH3COO- (acetate) + H+ + 2 H2 (1)  
 The cause of the acetate accumulation in these macrocosms (benzaldehyde amended and 
live-control) is not known but may be related to the low pH of the sediment (~5.9), the low 
initial number of methanogens and/or benzoate toxicity.  Acetate is an important substrate for 
methanogenic and iron reducing bacteria in anoxic environments and is known to be a major 
precursor of methane in sediments (Jones et al. 1989).  However, other workers have noted 
acetate accumulations in aquifer sediments.  In incubations of unamended sediment slurries, 
acetate accumulated over time (Jones et al. 1989) and elevated acetate concentrations have been 
reported for several contaminated aquifers (Cozzarelli et al. 1994; McMohan et al. 1995).  In a 
study evaluating factors influencing methanogenesis in an anoxic aquifer (Beeman and Suflita, 
1990), methanogenesis was severely inhibited at pH values < 7, suggesting that acetoclastic 
methanogenesis may have been inhibited by the low pH here.   
 In follow-up incubations of sediment from the no-added carbon macrocosms, acetate was 
degraded and methane accumulated.  However, methane was never produced and acetate never 
degraded in sediment from the benzaldehyde amended macrocosms.  The high benzoate 
concentrations in sediment from these macrocosms (> 7 mM) may also have inhibited 
methanogenic activity.  At pH 7, total benzoate concentrations greater than 40 mM (equivalent to 
0.04 mM benzoic acid) over a 100 hour period reduced methane production by over 50% in 
anaerobic granules adapted to methanogenic conditions (Fang et al. 1997).  In the benzaldehyde 
amended incubations, the sediment was exposed to greater than 0.1 mM benzoic acid for over 
two months. 
 Over the first 400 hours, the ethanol concentration declined by 2.3 mM while acetate 
increased by approximately 3.0 mM.  The somewhat greater than stoichiometric acetate 
production could be due to degradation of background organic carbon, release of sorbed acetate 
from the solid phase and/or minor analytical errors.  Fe(III) reduction is believed to be the 
primary terminal electron acceptor in the no added carbon microcosms since: (1) oxygen, nitrate 
and sulfate were below detection; and (2) Fe(II) produced during the first 400 hours was 
equivalent to 62% of the measured ethanol depletion in equation 1.  Lower than expected Fe(II) 
production may be due to loss of H2 from the macrocosm headspace during sampling.  In the no 
added carbon macrocosms, total anaerobes and Fe reducers increased by two orders of 
magnitude with Fe reducers continuing to be the dominant population (Table 2). 
 
ADDITION OF IRON MINERAL FORMS   
Separate microcosms were constructed using sediment and water from the benzaldehyde 
amended macrocosms.  The microcosms were amended with different iron mineral forms to 
determine if an added electron acceptor could shift the microbial activity away from 
fermentation and back to Fe reduction.  Ethanol and benzylalcohol degraded in all the iron 
treated microcosms, albeit at different rates, but did not degrade in microcosms without added 
iron (Fig. 4).  This indicates that the observed shift from iron reduction to fermentation was due 
to depletion of bioavailable iron.  Ethanol concentrations in iron oxyhydroxide and goethite 
treated microcosms dropped to < 0.01 mM in 300 and 400 hours respectively, while

should only substitute Fe(II) with Ca(II) on surface hydroxyl groups or surface-coating phase on 
the mineral.  However minor, this substitution clearly enhanced iron reduction.

portions of the aquifer.  Using this approach, the significance of iron reduction at 25 natural 
attenuation sites was evaluated and Fe(III) reduction was dominant at only 2 sites, while sulfate 
reduction and methanogenesis were dominant at the 23 remaining sites (Weidemeier et al. 1995).  
However in a landfill leachate polluted aquifer (Heron and Christensen, 1995), over 98% of the 
Fe(II) produced was not dissolved.  In our system, over 68% of Fe(II) produced accumulated on 
solid phase.  This Fe(II) was present as an ion exchangeable phase and as a NaAc extractable 
material consistent with FeCO3.  Fe(II) precipitation has been reported in several different 
organic contaminated aquifers (Heron et al. 1994; Baedecker et al. 1992).  These results further 
suggest that using only aqueous measurements of Fe(II) may significantly underestimate the 
extent of iron reduction.  
 At present, the significance of Fe(II) coating of iron oxide surfaces is poorly understood.  
In our work, ion exchanged and precipitated Fe(II) on the mineral surfaces reduced Fe(III) 
availability, resulting in an accumulation of reduced fermentation products.  In a related study 
(Roden and Zachara, 1996), over 90% of the Fe(II) produced by a dissimilatory Fe(III) oxide-
reducing bacterium was either incorporated as an adsorption complex or as a precipitate on the 
Fe(III) oxide surface.  Iron reduction slowed after approximately 2.7% of the available Fe(III) 
was reduced; however, washing the iron oxide with NaAc re-initiated Fe(III) reduction.  In a 
different study, Fe(II) sorption on oxide and cell surfaces, together with Fe(II) complexation by 
or precipitation with medium components, all influenced the rate and extent of Fe(III) reduction 
(Urrutia et al. 1998). 
 It is not clear whether Fe(II) coating is an important limitation on iron bioavailability in 
contaminated aquifers since other factors including advective flushing may limit Fe(II) 
precipitation.  Analysis of pristine and contaminated aquifer sediment at the site showed some 
depletion of Fe(III) in the contaminated zone but no detectable increase in Fe(II) (Borden et al. 
1994).  At the Vejen landfill in Denmark, decades of exposure to leachate resulted in complete 
depletion of iron oxides originally present in the methanogenic zone immediately downgradient 
of the landfill (0.5 N HCl extraction for 24 hrs was less than 1.8 mol/g) (Heron and 　
Christensen, 1995).  This occurred even though the groundwater was saturated with siderite and 
pyrite was precipitating near the landfill (Heron et al. 1994).

benzylalcohol were produced throughout the incubation period. However, the rate of 
benzylalcohol production increases after 250 to 300 hours. (d) The increase in the benzylalcohol 
production rate after 300 hours causes the ratio of benzylalcohol to benzoate to increase after 
300 hours.  Error bars represent standard deviation of triplicate live macrocosms.

二、 與會心得 
 
經過數天的交流，本人有下列之心得： 
土壤及地下水均是寶貴的環境資源，由於隱藏在地下環境，當發
生污染時，往往不易察覺，而任何污染持續與惡化，終會危害人類環
境與破壞生態。台灣地區人口稠密，各型產業發達，造成的污染問題
相當多，又因土地資源有限，亦常有缺水情形發生，相當仰賴良好的
土壤及地下水品質，故特別需要重視土壤及地下水污染概況。為了讓
民眾以及世代子孫有著舒適健康的生活品質，對於土壤之保護及其污
染的整治，已到了刻不容緩之地步。民國八十九年二月二日「土壤及
地下水污染整治法」公佈實施後，使得我國土壤及地下水之整治工作
邁向一個新的紀元。未來在舊有污染場址不斷的被發現，而新污染場
址持續增加的情形下，整治工作勢必日趨繁重。 
 
在土壤及地下水污染整治法的立法理念中明確指出，當土壤及地
下水的污染物濃度達到土壤污染的管制時，該場址予以公告為控制場
址，而當控制場址經初步評估後，如有危害國民健康和生活環境之虞
者，經在地主管機關報請中央主管機關審核後公告為整治場址。目前
被公告為整治場址之數目有日趨漸增的現象，如此一來更可突顯出尋
求最適合的土壤污染整治技術時為當務之急的研究趨勢。在許多不同
的污染場址整治工程中，通常所遭遇到的二個主要的問題為：（1）合
適的技術不易尋找；（2）在特定場址條件下，評估與選擇各種不同技
術的法則不易建立。為了推動新穎土壤及地下水整治技術之發展，美
國環保署在 1986 年運用了超級基金成立了“Superfund Innovative 
Technology Evaluation Program”（簡稱 SITE Program），其內容共包括
三部份：技術示範計畫、新穎技術開發計畫、量測與監測技術。近年
來土壤及地下水復育技術相關研究已漸漸朝向全面性及系統化之整合
架構邁進，針對油品污染場址之整治復育不論是物理、化學或生物處
理均有其處理成效，甚至以移除污染物、防止污染物釋出及轉化成其
他無害化物質(CO2 及 H2O)為整治目標。在整治過程中受到土壤生態
複雜、整治技術處理限制之差異、經濟成本考量、時效性以及民眾或
