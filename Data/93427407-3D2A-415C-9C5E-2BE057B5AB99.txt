Abstract 
In the present study, Pt or AgPd metal is used as the inner electrode for Bi2O3-doped ZnO multilayer 
varistors (MLV). The growth of the ZnO grains is constrained by the presence of the inner electrodes. The Pt 
inner electrodes are chemically inert to Bi2O3-doped ZnO. The Bi2O3 could react with Pd to form PdBi2O4. 
The Bi2O3-rich liquid also tends to wet the AgPd electrode. The size of ZnO grains in the MLV/AgPd 
specimen is larger. The ZnO grains in the MLV/AgPd specimen can even grow to a size larger than the layer 
thickness at the expense of the electrode continuity.  
Keywords: grain growth, laminated component, constrained sintering, electrode  
 
Introduction 
 
Many passive components nowadays are in multilayered structure due to the demands on miniaturization 
and integration. In order to increase the volume efficiency, the layer thickness is decreasing from tenths of 
micrometers to several micrometers in the last decade.1-3 The interactions between ceramic layers and inner 
electrodes thus become important to the performance of multilayered components.  
The ZnO-based ceramics exhibit unique nonlinear current-voltage (I-V) characteristics; they are commonly 
used as the varistors to protect electronic devices against voltage surges.4-7 Since many 3C electronic gadgets 
are now operated under a low voltage through rechargeable battery; the multilayer varistors (MLV) are 
developed for such low voltage applications.  
The multilayer varistor is composing of ZnO-based ceramic layers and inner electrodes. The basic 
requirement for the inner electrode is its ability to co-fire with the ceramic to elevated temperatures. Precious 
Pt has been used as the inner electrodes for some time; it has been proved to be suitable as the inner electrode 
for ZnO-based MLV.8 However, the cost of Pt is around 3 times that of the 70Ag/30Pd alloy. Due to such cost 
issue, the AgPd alloys are now considered as the candidate materials for inner electrode. Previous studies on 
multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCC) indicated that reactions could take place between AgPd and Bi2O3.3,9-11 
Since Bi2O3 is essential to the preparation of ZnO-based varistors, the interaction between the Bi2O3-doped 
ZnO and AgPd alloys at elevated temperature is a topic of increasing technological importance.  
 4 
min. There are eight layers of inner electrodes in the center of the MLV specimens; the particle packing in the 
middle part of the green specimen is not the same as that in the end parts. The shrinkage is larger in the 
middle part of the MLV specimens. Such larger shrinkage in the middle part may also induce some opening in 
the center of the MLV/Pt specimens, Fig. 2(a). Since the metallic Pt is relatively soft and ductile, the Pt 
electrodes are deformed and filled into most of the opening after grinding and polishing. Nevertheless, the Pt 
electrodes remain in their original positions after sintering at 1200°C. However, some AgPd electrodes are 
dis-appeared after sintering at 1100°C for 1000 min and at 1200°C for 60 min. A typical example is shown in 
Fig. 2(b). In the figure, there is only one thick electrode remained in the MLV/AgPd specimen. The remaining 
electrode is the one that close to the thinnest ceramic layer before sintering. For the MLV/AgPd specimens 
sintered either at a lower temperature or with a shorter time, the AgPd electrodes are intact after sintering.  
Fig. 3 shows the detailed microstructures for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd layers of the specimens shown in Fig. 2. 
The ZnO grains are elongated along the direction parallel to the Pt inner electrode in the MLV/Pt specimen. 
The Bi2O3-rich phase tends to perpendicular to the Pt electrode. In the MLV/AgPd specimens, the ZnO grains 
are more or less equiaxed. Isolated AgPd alloy grain is located between ZnO grains. The reaction phase, 
PdBi2O4 phase, and Bi2O3-rich liquid phase are in the form of sequential dendrites or layers, suggesting the 
following reaction is taken place during the cooling stage:  
  4242 OPdBiOBiPd !+       (1) 
Fig. 4 shows the size of ZnO grains within Pt or AgPd inner electrodes as a function of layer thickness. 
As the sintering temperature is lower than 1000°C, the size of ZnO grains is smaller than the layer thickness. 
Furthermore, the size of ZnO grains shows little dependence on the layer thickness. As the sintering 
temperature is higher than 1100°C, the size of ZnO grains increases with the increase of layer thickness. 
Comparing the specimens treated with the same sintering temperature, the size of ZnO grains in the 
MLV/AgPd specimens is larger than that in the MLV/Pt specimens.  
The composition mapping as determined by the EDX analysis in a MLV/Pt specimen is shown in Fig. 5. 
The Pt electrode is continuous within the MLV/Pt specimen after sintering at 1100°C for 1000 min, Fig. 5(d). 
The Bi2O3-rich phase mainly locates between the ZnO grains, Fig 5(d). There is hardly any Bi2O3-rich phase 
present at the ZnO/Pt interface. Fig. 6 shows the composition distribution in the MLV/AgPd specimen as 
determined by the EPMA analysis. It is worth noting that the Ag is no longer continuous in the MLV/AgPd 
specimen. At the discontinuous points between the AgPd electrodes (Fig. 6e), the Bi intensity is high (Fig. 6c). 
A minor amount of Pd is also found at the discontinuous points (Fig. 6f). It indicates that both Bi2O3-rich 
phase and PdBi2O4 are located at the discontinuous points of the AgPd electrodes. Furthermore, the Bi2O3-rich 
phase is found to surround the AgPd electrode (Fig. 6c).  
The I-V curves for the MLV/Pt and MLV/AgPd specimens are shown in Fig. 7. The breakdown voltage 
of MLV/Pt specimens decreases with the increase of sintering temperature, demonstrating that the size of ZnO 
grains increases with the increase of sintering temperature. Apart from the MLV/AgPd specimen prepared by 
sintering at 1200°C for 60 min, the breakdown voltage of MLV/AgPd specimen is lower than that of the 
MLV/Pt specimens. It is mainly due to that the size of ZnO grains in the MLV/AgPd specimen is larger. For 
the MLV/AgPd specimens sintered in the temperature range from 900 to 1100°C, the breakdown voltage of 
the MLV/AgPd shows little dependence on the sintering temperature. The breakdown behavior of varistor is 
dominated by the largest grain between inner electrodes.8 It thus indicates that some ZnO grains are relatively 
large in the MLV/AgPd specimens even when the sintering temperature is low. As the MLV/AgPd specimen 
 6 
Apart from the MLV specimens sintered at 1200°C, the nonlinear coefficient varies from 4-7 for the 
MLV/Pt specimens and from 2-3 for the MLV/AgPd specimens. The alpha values of the MLV/Pt specimens 
are around two times that of the MLV/AgPd specimens. The newly formed PdBi2O4 phase is a 
semi-conducting phase;3 its presence may lead to the decrease of alpha value.13  
The wetting of Bi2O3-rich phase on the inner electrode plays an important role on the microstructure 
stability of MLV. The wetting of Bi2O3-rich liquid on Pt is poor. Since the energy of ZnO-Bi2O3 boundary 
phase is low,14 a very thin Bi2O3-rich boundary phase is always existed between ZnO grains. The wetting of 
Bi2O3-rich liquid on AgPd is also good. The Bi2O3-rich liquid can thus wet the AgPd grains. Each AgPd grain 
then changes slowly to spherical shape to decrease its surface area. The Bi2O3-rich phase can also move 
across the discontinuous AgPd grains. The AgPd grains then become isolated to each other within the 
Bi2O3-doped ZnO matrix. The breakdown voltage of the MVL/AgPd is then increased.  
From the practical point of view, the choice of inner electrodes is important to the performance of MLV. 
Since the size of ZnO grains is larger in the MLV/AgPd specimens. The use of AgPd inner electrode can 
produce the MLV with lower breakdown voltage. However, there are limits for the sintering temperature and 
sintering time. The sintering temperature has to be low enough to limit the wetting of Bi2O3-rich phase on the 
AgPd grains. According to the previous study15, the presence of a small amount of Ag dopant (<0.76 mol%) 
promotes the grain growth of ZnO. The degree of the X-ray diffraction peaks of ZnO in the MLV/AgPd 
specimen is slightly lower than that of the peaks of ZnO in the MLV/Pt specimen, see Fig. 1, indicating that 
the lattice parameters of ZnO is larger in the MLV/AgPd specimen. Since the Ag+ ion (0.115 nm)16 is larger 
than that of Zn2+ ion (0.075 nm), it thus confirms the dissolution of some Ag into ZnO during co-firing.   
 
Conclusions 
 
In the present study, the feasibility of using AgPd alloy as the inner electrodes for MLV is evaluated. The 
Pd in AgPd alloy could react with Bi2O3 in the varistor composition. A minor Ag can dissolve into ZnO to 
promote its growth. The MLV/AgPd specimen can only be produced by sintering at a temperature lower than 
1100°C and a time shorter than 1000 min. The key is the wetting of the Bi2O3-rich liquid on the AgPd alloy 
during co-firing. The sintering temperature has to be low enough to produce a stable microstructure.

請就研究內容與原計畫相符程度、達成預期目標情況、研究成果之學術或應用價
值（簡要敘述成果所代表之意義、價值、影響或進一步發展之可能性）、是否適
合在學術期刊發表或申請專利、主要發現或其他有關價值等，作一綜合評估。
1. 請就研究內容與原計畫相符程度、達成預期目標情況作一綜合評估 
■達成目標 
□未達成目標（請說明，以 100 字為限） 
□實驗失敗 
□因故實驗中斷 
□其他原因 
說明： 
在非常小的陶瓷空間中的燒結及晶粒成長行為, 並不同於塊材的燒結及晶粒成長行為, 
例如陶瓷薄膜中的晶粒成長行為就不同於塊材的燒結及晶粒成長行為, 雖然學術界對陶瓷薄
膜的燒結及晶粒成長行為已有較完整的研究, 但對積層陶瓷元件內部的晶粒成長行為卻極少
探討, 其實陶瓷薄膜的晶粒成長行為與積層陶瓷元件內部的晶粒成長行為有極大差異. 
2. 研究成果在學術期刊發表或申請專利等情形： 
論文：■已發表 □未發表之文稿 □撰寫中 □無 
專利：□已獲得 □申請中 ■無 
技轉：□已技轉 □洽談中 ■無 
其他：（以 100 字為限） 
我們針對積層氧化鋅變阻元件進行晶粒成長行為的探討, 並發表十篇 SCI 論文, 其中五
篇發表在 SCI Subject category: Materials Science: Ceramics 類前三名的期刊上.
