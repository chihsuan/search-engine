EMD is affected by muscle fatigue, (Yeung 1999, Zhou 1998) muscle length, 
(Muraoka 2004) muscle training, (Kubo 2001) and the types of muscle activation. 
(Kaneko 2002) Kubo et al (2000) proposed that EMD was increased due to 
immobilization. Moreover, both the EMDs of VL in subjects with anterior cruciate 
ligament reconstruction (Kaneko 2002) and of peroneus longus in subjects with 
unstable ankle (Isabelle 2003, Vaes 2001) were significantly longer than those of the 
healthy individuals. However, there are few researches to investigate the EMD of VM 
and VL in the subjects with PFPS. 
Review the articles, the validity of measuring the VM and VL in the conventional way 
is questionable. The common tendon of the VM and VL passes over the patella and 
through the tibial tubercle. In the previous studies, the EMD of VM and VL were 
measured as the interval from the time of stimulation of the femoral nerve (Kaneko 
2002) or voluntary quadriceps contraction to the time of onset of knee extension force 
(Chan 2001, Georgoulis 2005, Kubo 2000, Yeung 1999, Zhou 1995). Three important 
issues concerning the measurement of EMD of the VM and VL require clarification: 1) 
the VM and VL cannot be activated individually by stimulating the femoral nerve or 
with voluntary quadriceps contraction, 2) the earlier firing muscle has the longest 
EMD because the measured EMD ends at the same time as the onset of mechanical 
output, 3) and the EMD measurement of the VM and VL is likely confounded by the 
patella and patellar tendon because they are situated between the muscle and the tibial 
tubercle. Therefore, we speculated that it is more accurate to measure the EMD of the 
VM and VL individually by stimulating the VM and VL directly instead of 
stimulating the femoral nerve and by determining the onset time of patellar movement 
instead of the onset time of knee extension force and the method should be 
established.  
EMD is the time interval between electrical activity and the mechanical response of 
the muscle. It includes the time course of 1) the propagation of action potential on 
muscle membrane, 2) the excitation-contraction coupling processes and 3) the 
stretching of the SEC by the contractile element. Previous scholars believed that the 
time taken for the last factor is considered a major portion of EMD. (Cavanagh 1979) 
Consequently, the EMD is also the time interval between the force produced by 
muscle fiber and the resultant bony movement. Therefore, the length of EMD is 
related to the speed of muscle force transmission. The mechanical properties of the 
SEC are regarded as the main factors to affect the length of EMD. A few studies were 
investigated in the effect of stiffness of SEC to the EMD. (Chan 2001, Isabelle 2003, 
Kubo 2000, 2001, Muraoka 2004) The stiffness is the slope of the curve formed by 
  4
injury in the past 6 months, or any neurological deficit that might affect the functions 
of the lower extremities. The subjects were examined on the dominant limb and rested 
on a bed in full muscle relaxation with their knees slightly flexed. All subjects were 
fully informed of the test procedures and the purpose of the study. Written informed 
consent approved by the Ethics Committee of the author’s university was obtained 
from all subjects. 
Measurement of the evoked EMD of VM or VL 
Activation of the muscle contraction of VM and VL. An electrical stimulator (Trio 300, 
ITO Co., Ltd., Japan) was used to activate the individual head of the quadriceps 
selectively. Two surface electrodes were placed on the motor points of the target 
muscle (VM and VL). To find the motor point of the target muscle, the electrodes 
were moved carefully to obtain the strongest muscle twitch with the lowest electrical 
stimulation current. A constant current stimulation pulse with 0.25 ms of pulse width 
was used to evoke the muscle twitch at 1-s intervals. 
For the purpose of synchronization, the signal of the electrical stimulation was 
transmitted to the ultrasound apparatus by way of the electrocardiography input 
channel. To protect the electrocardiography input channel of the ultrasound apparatus, 
the signal of the electrical stimulation was first passed through a customized circuit to 
lower the electrical current and voltage and then was transmitted into the input 
channel. Consequently, we captured the M-mode ultrasonography on which the 
electrical stimulation signal and the patellar movement were shown. 
To avoid worsening the image quality from the violent muscle twitch and resulting 
muscle fatigue, the intensity was increased gradually from 0 mA and was not 
increased any more as soon as the patellar movement was observed on the monitor of 
ultrasound apparatus. After five patellar movements at least being observed, the image 
was frozen and then the electrical stimulator was turned off. It was revealed that the 
intensity of electrical stimulation used for two muscles and all subjects were in the 
range of 25 mA to 30 mA while the patellar movement could be observed on the 
screen. 
Detection of patellar movement. The movement of the patella resulting from VM or 
VL contraction was monitored with the ultrasound apparatus (HDI 5000; ATL, Bothell, 
WA, USA). To eliminate pressure from the hand-held probe on the muscle belly and 
to ensure that the probe was immobile, the probe (5-12 Hz, linear array) was affixed 
  6
Image processing. A customized LabVIEW (Version 7.1, National Instruments, Austin, 
TX) program was designed to analyze the images. The frequency of the electrical 
stimulation signal was 1 Hz, and this signal was so distinct that we could easily 
identify its onset. The trace of the evoked patellar movement often appeared as a band 
rather than as a line (Fig. 2). To find the trajectory line of the patellar movement, we 
applied sharpening spatial filters by second-order derivatives to each column of the 
image (Rafael et al 2002). A critical value was obtained after the second-order 
derivatives to the grey level of all the pixels in the same column and it was indicated 
that this pixel had the largest change of grey level as comparing with the above one 
and the below one in that column. Then, the trajectory line of the patellar movement 
was defined as the line took shape by connecting all the pixels for which had the 
largest change of grey level in each column. Finally, the first point followed by twice 
continuously slope change in the same direction was considered the onset of the 
patellar movement (Fig. 3). The program was validated by analyzing the images that 
were simulated especially the known patellar tracking in the M-mode image of the 
ultrasonography. The time interval between the onset of the electrical stimulation and 
the onset of the evoked patellar movement was calculated. The average of three time 
intervals calculated from the last three electrical stimulation signals and patellar 
movement collected was served as the EMD of the target muscle.

Discussion 
The current study proposed a novel technique for measuring EMD of VM and VL by 
detecting patellar movement instead of knee extension force as the mechanical output 
when the VM and VL were stimulated individually. The results of the present study 
are demonstrated that the percentage of people whose the EMD of VM being larger 
than that of VL in subjects with PFPS are significantly different with those in healthy 
individuals. Therefore, we speculated that the EMD of VM is prolonged in subject 
with PFPS. The length of EMD is related to the velocity of muscle force transmission 
from muscle to the attached bone. (Georgoulis et al 2005) Moreover, the delayed 
onset of muscle activity of VM relative to VL in subject with PFPS was proved by 
previous study. (Cowan et al 2001) Therefore, it is revealed that there is not only the 
inconsistent neuromuscular control but also changed mechanical properties of the VM 
and the VL in patients with PFPS. And it is hypothesized that the prolonged EMD and 
the delayed onset of muscle activity of VM relative to VL may be contributive to 
adjust the patellar movement inefficiently, and then result in the abnormal patellar 
tracking. The related investigation in patellar motion analysis should be designed to 
test this hypothesis in the further work.  
The EMD values of VM and VL in PFPS patients have not yet been investigated in 
  10
movement can avoid interference from the mechanical properties of patellar tendon. 
Therefore, we suggest that the mechanical response of VM or VL should be occurred 
at patellofemoral joint rather than tibiofemoral joint. 
Conclusion 
The EMD of VM is prolonged in subject with PFPS. It is revealed that there are 
changed mechanical properties of the VM in patients with PFPS. Besides, we 
hypothesized that there are adaptive changes in the EMD of VM and VL for the 
patients with PFPS, and speculate that the adaptive changes will deteriorate the 
abnormal patellar lateral tracking.
