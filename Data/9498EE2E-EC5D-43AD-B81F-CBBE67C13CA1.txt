Diffraction of light refers to the wave phenomena in which the propagation of light 
does not follow the straight paths predicted by geometrical optics. The diffraction 
phenomena were first considered as an undesirable feature when it was first 
discovered. The development of holography was a big step historically in truly 
releasing the potential of the diffraction phenomena. In holography, an interference 
pattern of light from an object and a coherent reference wave is first recorded as a 
hologram; and in the reconstruction process, the image is reconstructed through the 
diffraction of a coherent beam [1]. The ability to transform a flat coherent wavefront 
to a recorded image by a hologram gave rise to the idea of wavefront processing, 
allowing the transformation of an input wavefront into another form through a 
holographic element. Subsequently, the development of holographic optical elements 
(HOEs) showed that complex wavefront manipulation can be achieved by the concept 
of holography [2]. Another common example is the holographic head up display 
(HUD), which can be found in almost all jet fighter cockpits. However, the 
interferometric HOE recording process still has limitations in terms of design 
versatility. 
With the development of modern computing tools and the advance of fabrication 
technology, the concept that overcomes this limitation was diffractive optics. In 
diffractive optics, the diffractive patterns required to perform the wavefront 
manipulation are produced by direct writing or micro-fabrication instead of the 
interference writing in holography [3]. The ability to perform wavefront 
manipulations with computer generated patterns has led to the development of digital 
spatial light modulators (SLMs), diffractive optical elements (DOEs), and many other 
interesting applications [4-6].  
Integrated optical components are important building blocks in modern 
communication and computing infrastructures [7]. Traditionally, these integrated 
optical devices are composed of simple waveguide components such as Y-branches, 
couplers, and single-mode waveguides, which put a limitation on the ability to 
achieve more complex or flexible architectures in designing photonic components and 
in the integration of planar light-wave circuits (PLCs). Many essential operations 
performed by these integrated components, such as beam splitting, mode 
transformation, wavelength demultiplexing and others, can be generalized as 
wavefront manipulations. It is thus natural to consider the design and fabrication of 
integrated optical components using the diffractive optics approach. However, due to 
the limitations in material processing expertise and in computer-aided design (CAD) 
tools, the field of integrated optics using the diffractive optics approach remains 
relatively unexplored. 
The recent advances of micro and nano fabrication technologies have allowed the 
realization of highly complex patterns on PLCs. Coupling the new fabrication 
capability with the rapid advance of computing power, it is now possible to calculate 
and fabricate diffractive patterns on a waveguide to perform wavefront manipulation. 
This new diffractive optics approach to integrated optical components uses unique 
refractive index distributions to transfer an optical input light pattern to a desired 
optical output pattern with near 100% efficiency. This approach provides a versatile 
technical platform for the development of the future generation integrated optical 
components and an opportunity to perform highly multi-disciplinary research in 
system integration for applications in areas ranging from optical communications to 
optical interconnect to ultrafast signal processing to sensing.  
Accordingly, in this project, we studied integrated optical components using the 
 3 
propagation direction. The finite difference beam propagation method (FD-BPM) has 
been shown to be accurate, computationally efficient, and stable compared to the 
conventional fast Fourier transform beam propagation method (FFT-BPM) [12]. A 
multi-step wide-angle scheme developed by Hadley [13,14] is used for our 
simulations.

We proposed the idea of diffraction engineering of multimode waveguides using 
CGPHs. The concept of designing fixed width multimode waveguides with variable 
SI lengths is verified. Based on the design concept, reduced SI lengths multimode 
waveguides are designed using SOI rib waveguide structures. The same principle can 
be applied to devices based on multimode interference.  
We have also proposed a MMI wavelength demultiplexer aided by the CGPH. 
Unlike conventional MMI demultiplexers, the device width and length are not limited 
to specific values as determined by the self-imaging properties. Using a design 
example, the design procedure for the CGPH is illustrated. BPM simulations are used 
to design the demultiplexer and analyze its performance. The same design principle 
can be applied to demultiplexers for different wavelengths.  
Finally, We have proposed an optical mode converter using adiabatic eigenmode 
evolution in multimode waveguides drawing analogies between optics and quantum 
mechanics. The coupling properties are analyzed using the coupled-mode theory. 
CGPHs are designed to implement the counterintuitive coupling scheme required for 
adiabatic mode conversion. Devices are designed on the SOI platform and simulated 
using the beam propagation method.  
This is a promising field of research that could lead to the development of key 
components in the next generation optical network.

Abstract: The self-imaging property in multimode waveguides is related to 
the waveguide widths and lengths. By engineering the diffraction properties 
of multimode waveguides, we propose a scheme to design devices with 
reduced self-imaging lengths at a fixed width. Using computer-generated 
planar holograms, the coupling coefficients between the guided modes are 
adjusted to generate the desired diffraction properties. Calculations based on 
the coupled-mode theory are presented. Devices are designed based on a 
silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. Beam propagation simulations are used 
to verify the coupled-mode theory analysis.

2. Coupled-mode theory 
We briefly review the properties of multimode waveguides. With the usual assumptions that 
the multimode waveguide is single-moded in the transverse direction, and the effective index 
method can be used to separate the transverse and lateral components of the electric field [5], 
the electric field in a multimode waveguide with M guided modes can be written as: 
      1( , ) exp ,

m m mE x z A z x j z     (1) 
where Am represents the mode amplitude, m represents the lateral mode profile, and m is the 
propagation constant in the z direction corresponding to the mth mode. The modes are 
normalized with the following condition [16]:

where  is the free-space wavelength, k0 = 2/, nr is the core effective index, and We is the 
effective width [5]. The quadratic dependence of the propagation constants with respect to 
mode number m results in the SI properties of multimode waveguides. A discussion on the 
image formation properties and possible split ratios can be found in [20]. We now consider 
the effect of CGPHs on the SI properties of the multimode waveguides, particularly on the 
propagation constants of the eigenmodes of the perturbed multimode waveguide. 
Similar to [17], we express the CGPH as an index perturbation on the multimode 
waveguide. It can be written as multiplexed long-period gratings by the following expression

After some algebraic calculations, we find that when 1 = 32, ’s are related by the 
quadratic relation in (10). We now show that the SI lengths can be engineered by properly 
choosing 1 and 2. 
We choose a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) rib waveguide structure to illustrate this 
numerically. The design parameters are chosen as follows: the waveguide height H is 3m, the 
slab height h is 2m, the buried oxide layer thickness d is 1m, and the width W of the 
waveguide is 10m. The device is optimized for 1.55m input wavelength and the TE 
polarization. Using a finite difference modesolver [21], we verified that this waveguide 
geometry supports 4 guided modes. Subsequent analysis is performed on the 2D structure 
obtained from the 3D structure using the effective index method [22]. Setting 1 = 32 = 
(2/)n, we use the CMT to calculate the A’ parameter in (10) by solving the eigenvalue Eq. 
(9) for different index modulation depths n. The results of the corresponding first mirror 
image lengths 3L’ are shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the SI lengths are reduced by 
properly designing the CGPHs. 
For a comparison, we consider uniform refractive index change throughout the multimode 
waveguide. From (11), the SI lengths reduce linearly with the index modulation depths n. 
The calculated SI lengths with uniform index modulations are shown in Fig. 1. From (14), we 
can observe that the perturbations to A’ in (10) is quadratic in nature to the first degree. As a 
result, the CGPH approach provides a greater control over the SI lengths then simply 
modifying the refractive index of the multimode waveguide uniformly.

waveguide.

5. Discussions and summary 
We presented an example using a four-moded waveguide to illustrate the ability to engineer 
the SI lengths of multimode waveguides by CGPHs. The particular CGPH consists of grating 
elements contributing only to the anti-diagonal of the matrix K in (9). As the mode number is 
increased in the multimode waveguide, a matrix K with perturbation entries not only on its 
anti-diagonal can always be found for its eigenvalues to be quadratically related [24]. It is 
beyond the scope of this work to evaluate all possible designs; rather, we focus on a specific 
design to illustrate the concept of diffraction engineering in multimode waveguides. 
The proposed CGPH approach provides a greater control over the SI lengths of multimode 
waveguides then simply uniformly modifying the refractive index. By a modest refractive 
index modulation of 0.06%, a 9% change in the SI lengths is observed in both the CMT 
calculation and the BPM simulation. The SI length reduction would be practically limited by 
the obtainable refractive index modulation by selective etching and the increased scattering 
loss. 
In summary, diffraction engineering of multimode waveguides using CGPHs is considered 
using the coupled-mode theory. The concept of designing fixed width multimode waveguides 
with variable SI lengths is presented. Based on the design concept, reduced SI lengths 
multimode waveguides are designed using SOI rib waveguide structures. The same principle 
can be applied to devices based on multimode interference.

1. Introduction 
Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is a key technology in optical fiber communication 
systems [1]. In WDM transmission systems, wavelength multiplexers/demultiplexers play 
essential roles in combining/separating information carried by different wavelengths. Of 
particular interests to optical telecommunications are the 1.31 µm and 1.55 µm windows. In 
fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) services, these two windows are used to carry data/voice and video, 
respectively [2]. Several integrated optical devices have been proposed or demonstrated for 
the demultiplexing of 1.31 and 1.55 µm wavelengths. Devices based on the application of 
multimode interference (MMI) phenomenon [3] are particularly attractive because of their 
large fabrication tolerance, low loss, and compact size [4]. 
In the past, several groups [5,6] have demonstrated wavelength demultiplexers for the 1.31 
and 1.55 µm based on MMI. The operation of these MMI based demultiplexers relies on the 
self-imaging (SI) effect in multimode waveguides [3]. The SI length is wavelength dependent, 
and two wavelengths can be separated if the device length is at the direct image length for one 
wavelength while at the mirror image length for the other. As a result, the device length needs 
to be a common multiple of the beat lengths for the two wavelengths [7], which could result in 
a long device length. To achieve a shorter device length, careful selection of device width and 
length through numerical simulations is required [6]. For a particular material platform, the 
available device geometry in terms of width and lengths is thus restricted. A MMI based 
multiplexer/demultiplexer with fewer restrictions on its geometry would be desirable in terms 
of design freedom. 
Recently, planar optical waveguide devices with computer calculated refractive index 
distributions have received a lot of attention [8–10]. The ability to design and fabricate these 
index perturbation on optical waveguides has opened up new possibilities in designing 
functional devices that are no longer limited by the traditional device geometries. In the past, 
we have proposed a class of devices using computer-generated planar holograms (CGPHs) on 
multimode waveguides to perform various functionalities [11–15]. These CGPHs are 
multiplexed long-period gratings that couple and transform the guided modes of the 
multimode waveguides. In this letter, we propose a 1.31/1.55 µm wavelength demultiplexer 
using CGPH on MMI devices. The design and optimization procedure of the CGPH is 
presented, and the device performance is investigated with numerical simulations. 
2. Principle of operation 
Figure 1 shows the operation schematic of the CGPH aided MMI wavelength demultiplexer. 
Two wavelengths, 1.31 and 1.55 µm, coupled into the input port are demultiplexed to the 
cross and bar output ports. For a conventional MMI, the length L of the multimode section 
needs to be a common multiple of the beat lengths for these two wavelengths such that the 
MMI is in cross and bar states at 1.31 and 1.55 µm, respectively. The beat length L, is related 
to the waveguide effective width We and the operating wavelength  as

where ne is the core effective index. As shown in ref [5], specific ratios of the beat lengths can 
be used to reduce L.

For the TE polarization at 1.55 µm, we use the BPM simulation to find the first self-
imaging length and set it as the length of the multimode section length L = 2720 µm  
[Fig. 2(a)]. Next, we calculate the CGPH that images the 1.31 µm input to the cross output 
port. The 1.31 µm optical field E1(z) do not image at L [Fig. 2(b)], and we wish to transform 
E1(z) to an optical field E2(z) which images to the cross output port. E2(z) is obtained by taking 
the conjugate of the mirrored image of E1(L) and using it as the input to the multimode 
waveguide. Because E2(0) is the phase conjugate replica of the mirrored image of E1(L), we 
expect E2(L) to form an image at the cross output port. This is verified by the BPM simulation 
shown in Fig. 3.

Here, we explain the design of a CGPH that diffract the E1 input field to the E2 field, 
which images to the cross output port. In the MMI without the CGPH, the fields E1 and E2 
obey the wave equation

Across the investigated spectral range, the MMI basically retains its spectral response 
except for the peak at 1.31 µm induced by the CGPH. Using the conventional approach, we 
have estimated that the MMI demultiplexer length needs to be three times the current device 
length of 2720 µm in order to be at a mirror image length for 1.31 µm. The proposed approach 
offers more flexibility in device geometry without sacrificing the compactness of the device. 
Further reduction of the device length to the first mirror image length for 1.55 µm is feasible

In conclusion, we have proposed a MMI wavelength demultiplexer aided by the CGPH. 
Unlike conventional MMI demultiplexers, the device width and length are not limited to 
specific values as determined by the self-imaging properties. Using a design example, the 
design procedure for the CGPH is illustrated. BPM simulations are used to design the 
demultiplexer and analyze its performance. The same design principle can be applied to 
demultiplexers for different wavelengths.

can be used for (1)

The matrix is Hermitian [4]. When the coupling coefficients
’s vary adiabatically, we can assume that the field compo-
nents evolve as

The resulting eigenvalue problem is
(5)
which yields the eigenmodes of the waveguide. The matrix
has a zero eigenvalue with the corresponding eigenmode
(6)
and the other two eigenmodes are
(7)
where is . The objective of adiabatic mode con-
version is to control the eigenmodes of in order to modify
the power distribution among the guided modes of the unper-
turbed waveguide. The eigenmode does not have contri-
bution from mode 1 and provides a path to convert mode 0 to
mode 2 without the excitation of mode 1 as explained below.
According to the adiabatic theorem, when the eigenmode
is excited initially, the system will remain in it if the
coupling coefficients are varied slowly. From (6), if the two
variable coupling coefficients and are applied in
a counterintuitive scheme as in Fig. 1, where precedes
, then approaches infinity at the input. If mode 0 is in-
cident in the waveguide, then the eigenmode
will be excited, which corresponds to mode 0 of the unperturbed
waveguide. At the output , approaches 0, the eigenmode
has adiabatically evolved to , corresponding
to mode 2 of the unperturbed waveguide. As a result, mode
2 will exit the waveguide. Adiabatic mode conversion from
mode 0 to mode 2 is thus achieved, and the choice on device
parameters is more relaxed as long as is varied slow enough
such that adiabatic evolution is ensured.
III. BEAM PROPAGATION SIMULATION
In the following example, we design the CGPH to implement
a counterintuitive coupling scheme with Gaussian-shaped cou-
pling coefficients as in [10]. We choose a silicon-on-insulator
(SOI) rib waveguide structure as in [17] for numerical simula-
tion. The length of the mode converter is 25 mm, which is

chosen so that the adiabatic condition is satisfied [10], [14]. The
device is optimized for 1.55- m input wavelength and the TE
polarization. Subsequent analysis is performed on the two-di-
mensional (2-D) structure obtained from the three-dimensional
(3-D) structure using the effective index method [18].
We use the wide-angle beam propagation method (WA-BPM)
[18] for device simulation. The Gaussian-shaped coupling co-
efficients are shown in Fig. 1. Using the design procedure out-
lined in [4], the corresponding CGPH pattern with a maximum
refractive index modulation of 0.003 is calculated and shown in
Fig. 2. In the simulations presented below, the CGPH in Fig. 2
is used as a perturbation to the core effective index. The calcu-
lation window is discretized into m m pixels in the
simulation.
Fig. 3 shows the results of the WA-BPM simulation. When
mode 0 is incident in the waveguide, the power is adiabatically
converted from mode 0 to mode 2 along the propagation direc-
tion. The inset in Fig. 4 shows the input and output electric field
profiles from the simulation. Calculated field profile of mode 0
is used as the input, and it is clear from the output field pro-
file that mode 0 is converted to mode 2 at the output. Fig. 4
shows the power in each guided mode along the propagation
