Broadband Dielectric Resonator Antenna with
Metal Coating
Principal Investigator: Jean-Fu Kiang
Abstract— In this paper, a broadband dielectric resonator (DR)
antenna is proposed, which consists of a rectangular DR coated
with metal on three sides and placed on a ground plane. The
structure is analyzed by modelling the dielectric-air interface as
perfect magnetic conductor (PMC). A coplanar waveguide (CPW)
with terminating slots is used to feed the antenna. Measurement
results exhibit a wide bandwidth of about 47% over which the
Eθ pattern on the horizontal plane is nearly omnidirectional. The
10-dB bandwidth of this broadband DR monopole covers 4.2-6.8
GHz. Hence, it can be used for WLAN 802.11a applications.
Index Terms— Dielectric resonator antenna, monopole an-
tenna.
I. INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of wireless communication demands broad-
band antennas which can be embedded within a handset to
provide versatile applications. Since it is difficult to obtain
wide impedance bandwidth with single resonant antenna,
multiple antennas with different operating frequencies have
been integrated to satisfy the bandwidth requirement [1], [2].
High-permittivity dielectric material has been used in mi-
crowave circuits such as filters or oscillators [3]. In order to
facilitate the design of dielectric resonator, a heuristic approach
that models the dielectric-air interface as a perfect magnetic
wall was proposed to predict the resonant frequencies of cylin-
drical resonators in 1965 [4]. Since 1983, dielectric resonators
have been designed as antenna elements by exciting different
modes of DR using conventional feeding mechanisms [5].
A DR antenna exhibits a broader bandwidth if its Q factor is
lower. In [6], a notched rectangular DR antenna with a low Q
factor is proposed. By lifting a DR above the ground plane, its
Q factor can be effectively reduced [7]. The bandwidth of DR
can also be increased by modifying its geometry. For example,
a truncated tetrahedral DR with its narrow base attached to the
ground reaches an impedance bandwidth of 40% [8]. A split
conical DR with split side attached to the ground can reach a
bandwidth of 50% [9].
High-permittivity material can be used to reduce the size
of DR at the expense of bandwidth reduction. However, DRs
with larger aspect ratio has been used to reduce the Q factor
and hence obtain a wider impedance bandwidth [10], [11].
Multiple DRs with close resonant frequencies can exhibit
broadband characteristics by coupling their resonant modes.
For example, two cylindrical DRs can be stacked to couple
their HEM11δ modes [1]. In [2], two rectangular DRs with
different sizes are placed at proximity, leaving a slot to couple
their TEy111 modes.
The bandwidth of DR antenna can also be extended by
attaching additional parasitic elements to incur another res-
onance. In [12], two metal strips are attached to the top of
a DR to incur additional resonance close to that of the DR.
The inductance of the metal strip and the capacitance between
the strip and the ground plane form an LC tank which can be
coupled to the DR resonant mode to exhibit a wider bandwidth.
The impedance bandwidth of DR antennas can be further
increased by modifying their feeding structures. In [13], a
coupling slot is proposed to excite the DR. The resonant modes
of slot and DR are coupled to increase the antenna bandwidth.
In [14], a patch resonant mode and a dielectric resonant
mode are coupled to increase the DR antenna bandwidth. The
signal is fed from the microstrip feed line, through the slot
on the ground plane and the slot on the patch, to the DR. In
[15], a DR is attached to a circular slot and an eccentric ring
slot to achieve a broad bandwidth. A grounded metal plate
placed in a plane of symmetry of the electric field distribution
can reduce the DR size by half without perturbing the original
field distribution. In [16], a rectangular DR integrated with an
inverted L-plate antenna is proposed. The DR not only serves
as a radiator but also serves as a feeding element for the L-
plate.
Typical bandwidth of a rectangular DR antenna is about
6-10%, which can be increased to more than 10% by using
lower-permittivity dielectric at the cost of increasing the DR
size. Stacking DRs of different sizes or using parasitic DRs can
further increase the impedance bandwidth to more than 20%
[1], [2]. The former incurs a higher antenna profile, while
the latter occupies larger space. Stacking DRs of different
permittivities can achieve well coupling to microstrip line and
a wider bandwidth of 40 % simultaneously. However, the
antenna complexity increases. Conical or truncated conical DR
can provide more than 50% of impedance bandwidth, but the
radiation pattern varies over the band due to the presence of
higher-order modes [9].
In this work, a broadband dielectric resonator antenna with
a nearly-omnidirectional radiation pattern is proposed. The
dielectric resonator is partially coated with metal on its surface,
which can be modeled as a cavity having PEC and PMC walls
on different portions of the surface. The resonant modes of
the DR are investigated. The electric field and the current
distributions of these modes are carefully studied to understand
their relation to the radiation patterns. The metal coating is
also fed as a monopole. The input impedance can be matched
by adjusting the DR position and the slot length, and broad
bandwidth is achieved by coupling the resonant modes of the
metal-coated DR and the monopole.

mode, and a pair of open-circuited slots at the end of the CPW
are used to excite the DR mode.
Fig. 4(b) shows the layout of the feeding structure, and Fig.
4(c) shows the photograph of the DR-monopole antenna. The
DR is placed over the terminating slots of the CPW, and the
length of the terminating slots is l. The size of ground plane
is LG × WG, and the thickness of the substrate is t. The
width w and the gap g of the CPW are adjusted to obtain
the characteristic impedance of 50 Ω.
By tuning the monopole height and the dimensions of DR,
the resonant frequencies of the monopole and the fundamental
mode of DR can be moved close to each other. By changing
the lengths of the terminating slots l and the offset between
the DR and the terminating slots s, good impedance matching
can be achieved. The broad impedance bandwidth is achieved
by coupling the resonant bands of the monopole and the

The 10-dB bandwidth is about 47.3% (4.2-6.8 GHz), which
is wide enough to cover the IEEE 802.11a applications. Two
nulls occurs at 4.56 GHz and 6.32 GHz, which are close to
the resonant frequencies of the monopole and the fundamental
mode of DR, respectively.
Fig. 6 shows the radiation patterns generated by the DR-
monopole with coating on three sides and five sides, respec-
tively. For frequency associated with the monopole mode, the
DR-monopole with three-side coating has a more omnidirec-
tional Eθ pattern on the xy-plane than that with five-side
coating. The Eφ component with three-side coating is lower
than that with five-side coating at φ = 75◦. For frequency as-
sociated with the fundamental mode of DR, the DR-monopole
with three-side coating also has a more omnidirectional Eθ
pattern on the xy-plane that that with five-side coating. Hence,
the DR with three-side coating is preferred.
Figs. 7 and 8 show the measurement and simulation radia-
tion patterns at f = 4.56 GHz and f = 6.32 GHz, respectively.
At f = 4.56 GHz, the Eθ pattern on the xy-plane is nearly
omnidirectional, with the gain of about 1.2 dBi. The horizontal
current exists on the side metal coating as shown in Fig. 3
and incurs Eφ component with multiple lobes. Hence, the Eφ
component is only a few dB lower than the Eθ component in
some directions. The Eθ pattern on the yz-plane is symmetric,
and the maximum gain of 3.2 dBi occurs at θ = 44.6◦. The
Eθ pattern on the xz-plane is asymmetric, and the maximum
gain of 5.2 dBi occurs at θ = 33◦.
At f = 6.32 GHz, the horizontal current on the side coating
as shown in Fig. 2(b) incurs Eφ components on the xy-plane

Broadband Dielectric Resonator Antenna with an
Offset Well
Principal Investigator: Jean-Fu Kiang
Abstract— A broadband dielectric resonator (DR) antenna
with an offset well is proposed. The well perturbs the original
field distribution in the DR block to increase the impedance
bandwidth associated with the TEy111 mode. The feeding aperture
generates a similar radiation pattern at adjacent band. The
overall bandwidth covers the 5-6 GHz band of WLAN 802.11a.
Index Terms—Dielectric resonators, slot antennas.
I. INTRODUCTION
The loss of DR antennas at high frequency is lower than
conventional patch antennas. Different approaches have been
proposed to increase the impedance bandwidth of the former,
for example, stacking multiple dielectric resonators with dif-
ferent resonant frequencies [1], inserting an air gap or a low-
permittivity substrate between DR and the ground plane [2],
[3].
Alternative approaches based on reducing the Q factor of
DRs have been proposed to incur a wider impedance band-
width, for example, carving a notch [4], drilling a cavity off
DR and fill it with lower-permittivity material [5], perforating
holes in DR [6]. The impedance bandwidth can be increased
by exciting different modes with close resonant bands [7]. DR
antennas can also be combined with other types of antennas
like patch or ring slot to extend their bandwidth [8], [9].
In this work, a broadband DR antenna is proposed. A well
is drilled off the DR to perturb the original electric field
distribution of the TEy111 mode, thus reducing its Q factor.
The effect of the well dimensions on the resonant frequency
is studied. The coupling aperture also serves as a slot antenna,
and its band is merged with that of the TEy111 mode to achieve
a wider bandwidth.
II. DIELECTRIC RESONATOR WITH A WELL
Fig. 1(a) shows a DR antenna with a well, fed by a
microstrip line through aperture coupling. A rectilinear DR
of dimensions a × b × d is adhered to the ground plane, and
a well of size s1 × s2 × d is drilled off the DR with an offset
p between the well center and the DR center. The dimension
of the coupling aperture is La × wa, and the microstrip line
extends over the aperture by length Ls.
Fig.2 shows the electric field distribution of the TEy111 mode
within the rectilinear DR with or without the well. When a
well is drilled off the DR, the electric field distribution is
perturbed. Since the permittivity of the DR (r0) is much
larger than that of the air (0), the electric field within the
well is significantly enhanced, as depicted in Fig.2(b), enabling
more effective radiation. Hence, the Q factor is decreased, and
a wider bandwidth is obtained.

Fig. 3 shows the effect of well dimension on the resonant
frequency. The 10-dB impedance bandwidth of the DR with a
well is wider than that without well, and is increased as either
s1 or s2 is increased. Note that the well dimensions do not
affect the radiation patterns significantly.
Let (E¯0, H¯0) and (E¯, H¯) be the field distributions of the
TEy111 mode without and with the well, respectively, ω0 and
ω be the resonant frequencies of the TEy111 mode without and
with the well, respectively. The resonant frequency of the DR

and the relative position between the DR and the aperture

frequency and the input impedance. Fig.6 shows the measured
and simulated return loss of the DR with an offset well. The
10-dB impedance bandwidth is about 18%(5-6 GHz), which
covers the WLAN 802.11a bands. The two nulls are associated
with the slot antenna mode and the TEy111 mode of the DR,
respectively.
Fig.7(a) shows the radiation pattern associated with the slot
mode. The half-power beamwidth of the Eθ pattern is about
84◦ (−42◦ ≤ φ ≤ 42◦), and the cross-polarization (Eφ) over
the half-power beamwidth is 10 dB lower than the vertical
polarization. The gain is 5.6 dBi at φ = 0◦. Fig.7(b) shows
the radiation pattern associated with the TEy111 mode of the
DR. The half-power beamwidth of the Eθ pattern is about 94◦
(−48◦ ≤ φ ≤ 46◦), and the cross-polarization over the half-
power beamwidth is 12 dB lower than the vertical polarization.
The gain is 4 dBi at φ = 0◦. Note that the back radiation
associated with the slot mode is stronger than that associated
with the TEy111 mode. For WLAN applications, for example,
this DR antenna can be mounted on the wall with the z-axis
pointing to ceiling, providing a broadside radiation pattern
with vertical polarization on the xy-plane in front of the wall.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, the bandwidth of the TEy111 mode of DR is
increased by drilling a well, and is further extended by merging
with the band of the slot mode, achieving a wider bandwidth
of 18%(5-6 GHz). The Eθ pattern on the xy-plane has a half-
power beamwidth of about 90◦ over the impedance bandwidth.
Its gain is higher than 4 dBi. This antenna can be used in
WLAN 802.11a applications.

的範圍上空，具有趨近於全向性和右手圓極化的場型，且
天線的波束越寬，所能接受到的衛星訊號數也越多。 
由於體積小以及圓極化特性之需求，天線之設計中，
多通道、相位中心以及天線位置是重要的考量因素。然而，
多通道干擾是造成 GPS 應用上出現誤差的主要來源之一，
且要減少由於低仰角所造成的多通道干擾，在設計時可以
使用大的接地面或是讓天線場型在低仰角時具有零點
(null)。但是 GPS 衛星傳送右手圓極化信號，受到接地面或
其他物體反射後，會變為左手圓極化信號。如果能讓反射
的信號落在 GPS 天線的主波束內，具有良好軸比(axial ratio)
的天線會更有效率地接收直接由衛星傳送的右手圓極化信

前述本發明雙臂螺旋天線結構中，該輸出入單元(1)係
一基板(13)上設置一混波器(11)所構成，該基板(13)係可選
用FR4 電路板、氧化鋁板、陶瓷板或其它習知基板中的一

(hybrid)，用以配合該天線單元(2)之寬頻特性，且具有相同
的輸出入埠阻抗的環形四埠網路混波器。該混波器(11)之
環狀部(11a)的平均半徑(R)和傳輸訊號波長(λg)的關係為
2πR=1.5λg，且該環狀部(11a)形成一第一傳輸埠(11b)、一
第二傳輸埠 (11c)、一第三傳輸埠 (11d)以及一第四傳輸埠
(11e)，其中，各個鄰傳輸埠之間的距離係λg/4，惟該第一
傳輸埠(11b)以及第三傳輸埠(11d)之位置相差 3λg/4，相當
於該環狀部(11a)之環狀位置上相差 180 度。因此，當在第
一傳輸埠(11b)輸入訊號時，此訊號會在第二傳輸埠(11c)與
第三傳輸埠(11d)輸出強度相同且相位差 180 度的信號，且

輸入電抗約為 50Ω。當頻率小於 1.2GHz 時，雙螺旋天線

度會產生明顯的反射電流，以致於把前後比(front-to-back

1.6GHz時，可得螺旋線總長度(Nl)對應為 2.3λ，並由k-β

另外，要減小反射電流的方式之ㄧ就是在螺旋線尾端

DOUBLE-ARM HELIX ANTENNA 
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
[0001] This invention relates to the field of a double-arm helix antenna.   
2. THE PRIOR ARTS 
[0002] For wireless telecommunication, a double-arm helix antenna may generate a 
back-fire radiation suppose it is configured having a helix radius of 0.1 wavelength 
and a pitch angle of 10 degrees approximately, according to Nakano and Pattern. Such 
a back-fire beam of the double-arm helix antenna will be further split under the 
conditions of a helix radius of 0.1 wavelength and a pitch angle of 40 degrees 
according to Pattern’s experiments, while the back-fire beam is circularly polarized 
under the conditions of a small radius and a pitch angle of 68 degrees approximately 
according to Nakano, in which the main beam will be moved laterally as the 
frequency goes higher. 
[0003] Since a double-arm helix antenna resembles a single-arm helix antenna in 
structure, therefore, the phase difference between one arm and the next is almost 
constant when actuating a K-arm helix antenna, and the results of its analysis are 
about the same with an infinite-arm helix antenna. Based on this conclusion, a 
traveling-wave pattern multi-arm helix antenna can be designed by means of the same 
theory applied to a single-arm helix antenna.          
[0004] In practical use, the frequency band of GPS is allocated at 
1,575.42±1.023MHz and 1,227.6±1.023MHz, while that of the GLONASS is 
allocated at 1,598.0625~1,615.5MHz and 1,242.9~1,256.5MHz. For receiving 
satellite’s signals, a receiver antenna must be an antenna having omni-directional field 
pattern and RHCP (Right-handed circular polarization) with respect to all possible 
 1
literature looks somewhat more complicated to increase the difficulties of fabrication 
process. 
[0008] In addition to the feed network, a contingent design is required at a terminal 
of the helix antenna for the reason that a forward radiation can be generated by the 
reflection current to thereby affect the front-to-back ratio of the antenna field pattern. 
Documents have suggested some solutions, such as decreasing the reflection current 
by loading a resistor or improving the front-to-back ratio by providing a horn opening, 
in which, through the design of  horn opening, the bandwidth of input impedance can 
also be widened in addition to the improvements of the front-to-back ratio. However, 
its operation mechanism is rather complicated and hence its fabrication process is 
more difficult, and that is the reason why this invention is presented. 
 
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
[0009] A double-arm helix antenna is presented for solving the problems 
mentioned above, therefore, the primary objective of this invention is to provide a 
helix antenna for application to GPS and GLONASS satellite communications by 
availing itself of circular polarization, wide beam, and omni-directional field patterns. 
[0010]  Another objective of this invention is to provide a double-arm helix antenna 
by means of building an antenna design criteria covering the frequency bands of GPS 
and GLONASS through a sheath helix model.  
[0011] Yet another objective of this invention is to provide a double-arm helix 
antenna operable in either a normal mode or an axial mode, both of which possess 
circular polarization. When the circumference of a helical line is shorter than a 
wavelength, the helix antenna is operated in the normal mode, where the main beam 
points laterally. When the circumference of a helical line is equal in length to a 
 3
of a ring part and a plurality of transmission ports; and an antenna unit consisting of a 
shell and an impedance transformer, in which the shell is a cylindrical hollow tube 
laid on the substrate above the output/input unit, on which a first and a second helical 
line are wound in parallel with each other, and the bottom ends of those two helical 
lines are electrically connected together; and the impedance transformer is composed 
of a first transmission line and a parallel second transmission line, in which the top 
ends of both the first and the second transmission line are electrically connected to the 
top end of the first and the second helical line, respectively, and the bottom end of the 
first and the second transmission line are electrically connected to different 
transmission ports of the hybrid, where the bottom end of the first and second helical 
line are meanwhile electrically connected to a resistance load.           
[0016] For more detailed information regarding advantages or features of this 
invention, at least one example of preferred embodiment will be described below with 
reference to the annexed drawings.

invention is comprised of an output/input unit (1) and an antenna unit (2). 
[0034] In this antenna architecture, the output/input unit (1) is built by laying a 
hybrid (11) on a substrate (13), in which the substrate (13) could be an FR4 circuit 
board, alumina board, ceramic board, etc., having a surface (13a) coated with a 
metallic conductive layer; the hybrid (11) is a microstrip-line pattern formed by the 
metallic conductive layer on the surface (13a) of the substrate (13), and consists of a 
ring part (11a) and a plurality of transmission ports. Referring further to Fig. 2, the 
hybrid (11) is a broadband hybrid matched with the broadband characteristics of the 
antenna unit (2) and is also a ring type four-port network hybrid provided with 
identical output/input port impedances. The relation between the average radius (R) 
and the wavelength of transmission signal (λg) of the ring part (11a) of the hybrid(11) 
may be represented by 2πR=1.5λg, and the ring part (11a) includes a first 
transmission port (11b), a second transmission port (11c), a third transmission port 
(11d), and a fourth transmission port (11e), in which the interval from each port to an 
adjacent port is λg/4, with the exception of the distance of 3λg/4 from the first 
transmission port (11b) to the third transmission port (11d)  encircling the ring part 
(11a) by 180o. Therefore, if a signal is input into the first transmission port (11b), then 
a signal with the same amplitude and in opposite phase (180o) will be output through 
the second and the third transmission ports (11c, 11d) while keeping the fourth

[0037] Referring to Figs. 4a and 4b, suppose the operating frequency is 1.6GHz 
(along the solid line), the maximum gain of antenna is 7.5dB, HPBW (Half-power 
beam width) is 100 degrees, and the HPBW is 174 degrees when the axial ratio is 
below 5dBi, where the front-to-back ratio is 15dB; and suppose the operating 
frequency is 1.2GHz (along the dash line), the maximum gain of the antenna is 5dB, 
HPBW is 140 degrees, and the HPBW is 160 degrees when the axial ratio is below 
5dB, then, the front-to-back ratio is 10dB, under the conditions that the pitch angle of 
the helix line is 30 degrees, the number of turns is 3, and the shell radius is 20 mm; 
Fig. 4a shows an RHCP gain field pattern while Fig. 4b shows an axial-ratio gain field 
pattern; in the RHCP gain filed pattern of Fig. 4a, each radial grid represents 10dB 
and the outermost circle is 10dB, while in the axial ratio gain field pattern of Fig. 4b, 
each radial grid represents 2dB and the outermost circle is 8dB. 
[0038] Fig. 5 is a curve showing the relation between frequency and input 
impedance of a preferred embodiment of the double-arm helix antenna of this 
invention. 
[0039] As shown in Fig. 5, the solid line represents the relation between input 
resistance and frequency, and the dash line represents the relation between input 
reactance and frequency, under the conditions that the pitch angle of the helix line of 
this invention is 30 degrees, the number of turns is 3, and the shell radius is 20 mm. It 
is obvious from the figure that the traveling-wave behavior is more distinct when the 
frequency is greater than 1.2GHz, where the input resistance is 300 ohms and the 
input reactance is 50 ohm approximately. When the frequency is lower than 1.2GHz, 
the double-arm helix antenna behaves like a resonant antenna, where the bandwidth of 
input impedance is greater than that of the radiation field pattern, and the reactance 
can be neglected in the design of feed network.

lines; a signal being input into the first transmission port (11b) of the ring hybrid (11) 
shown in Fig. 2 and outputfrom the second and third transmission port (11c, 11d) 
connected to each transmission line of the impedance transformer (23); the other end 
of the impedance transformer (23) being in connection with a corresponding helical 
line of the antenna unit, where each radial grid is 10dB, the outermost circle is 10dB, 
the solid line represents the RHCP, and the dash line represents the LHCP. Fig. 7a is a 
gain field pattern of a preferred embodiment of the double-arm helix antenna of this 
invention operated at frequency 1.6GHz with an open load end, while Fig. 7b is a gain 
field pattern of a preferred embodiment of the double-arm helix antenna of this 
invention operated at frequency 1.2GHz with an open load end. Suppose the 
double-arm helix antenna is operated at frequency 1.2GHz, we obtain a single helical 
circumference of 0.5λand a corresponding total length of helical line (NL) of 1.74λ
with a small attenuation rate and a propagation constant approaching that in air. 
In this case, an apparent reflection current is generated owing to the small 
attenuation rate and the short total length of helical lines, hence the 
front-to-back ratio can be reduced to 2dB approximately. And, suppose the 
double-arm helix antenna is operated at frequency 1.6GHz, the corresponding 
total length of helical line (NL) is 2.3λ, and a relatively larger attenuation 
rate is predictable based on a k-β curve, and hence, the front-to-back ratio is 
larger at 1.6GHz than at 1.2GHz. Figs. 7a and 7b show that the front-to-back 
ratio decreases with an increasing frequency, it implies a standing-wave 
distribution of the current in the helix antenna when the attenuation rate of 
current is small, or on the contrary, in the case of a relatively higher frequency, 
the traveling-wave current is attenuated gradually though, there is no way to 
get zero whatever attenuated at the other end of the helical line, therefore, 
 11
antenna is 90 degrees, the front-to-back ratio is 23dB, and the beam width is wider 
than 120 degrees with the axial ratio smaller than 6dB.     
[0047] Figs. 10a through 10c are curves showing relation between axial ratio and 
frequency and between beam width and frequency of a preferred embodiment of the 
double-arm helix antenna of this invention.  
[0048] As shown in Figs. 10a~10c, the pitch angle of the helical lines is 30 degrees, 
the number of turns of helical line is 3, the shell radius is 20 mm, the width of 
transmission line of the impedance transformer is 1 mm, the interval of transmission 
line is 4 mm, N1 is the axial ratio, N2 is the beam width of which the axial ratio is 
smaller than 6dB, N3 is the HPBW having specified antenna heights (length of 
impedance transformer) and ring hybrid radii. In Fig. 10a, the height of the 
double-arm helix antenna is 240mm; the ring hybrid radius is 29mm; the frequency 
band with the axial ratio lower than 6dB is in the range from 1.15GHz to 1.65GHz. 
Because the ring hybrid limits the bandwidth, therefore, when frequency is higher 
than 1.65GHz or lower than 1.15GHz, the effectiveness of antenna is weakened owing 
to power imbalance or difference, in which the side lobes start to appear when 
frequency is higher than 1.65GHz. In Fig. 10b, the double-arm helix antenna is 
300mm high; the radius of ring hybrid is 29mm; the corresponding frequency band 
with axial ratio lower than 6dB is from 1.2GHz to 1.85GHz; whereby it is obvious 
that a higher antenna is advantageous for  increasing the bandwidth of filed pattern. 
In Fig. 10c, the double-arm helix antenna is 300mm high; the radius of ring hybrid is 
23mm; the center frequency of the ring hybrid is 1.6GHz; the frequency band where 
the axial ratio is lower than 6dB is in the range from 1.1GHz to 1.8GHz, and it is 
possible to obtain a better performance in beam width than those in Figs. 10a and 10b. 
 13
to somewhere underneath the horizon; when the parameters  are moved over a 
boundary line S4, the fork beam will exhibit multiple lobes. Thus, it is possible to 
design the geometrical dimensions of  the helical lines in accordance with the 
parameter distribution chart of single beam as well as fork beam and select a proper 
operating frequency. 
[0051] In the above description, at least one preferred embodiment has been

numerous changes or modifications may be made without departing from the true
